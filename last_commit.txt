+Changelog
+=========
+
+4.2.19 (unreleased)
+-------------------
+
+- Handle commands registered for zopectl as well,
+  up to now they were handled but not displayed at all
+  (ie in help and descriptions).
+  https://github.com/plone/plone.recipe.zope2instance/issues/18
+  [gforcada]
+
+
+4.2.18 (2015-07-27)
+-------------------
+
+- Allow to disable logs.  Set ``z2-log`` to the value ``disable`` to
+  disable the Z2 access log.  Set ``event-log`` to the value
+  ``disable`` to disable the event log.
+  [frapell]
+
+
+4.2.17 (2015-04-29)
+-------------------
+
+- Added `zope-conf-imports` option to easily import ZConfig components
+  within zope.conf using %import syntax.
+  [avoinea]
+
+
+4.2.16 (2014-11-01)
+-------------------
+
+- If ''demo-file-storage' is set, but 'demo-storage' is off, do not
+  raise an exception
+  [frapell]
+
+- Add documentation for console command, for supervisor and IDE
+  debugging
+  [do3cc]
+
+
+4.2.15 (2014-09-07)
+-------------------
+
+- Always wrap contents of zcml-additional with a <configure /> node.
+  This makes it possible to use += assignments with zcml-additional.
+  [lgraf]
+- Add support for multiple zeo servers
+  [ivant]
+
+
+4.2.14 (2014-03-02)
+-------------------
+
+- Link to zope.conf is now relativitize if option relative-paths is true.
+  [bsuttor]
+- Added ability to set ``initialization`` to configure Python
+  code to run on instance start up.
+  [davidjb]
+- added support for http-header-max-length
+  [alecghica]
+
+
+4.2.13 (2013-07-28)
+-------------------
+
+- adding support for zopectl umask
+  [hman]
+
+
+4.2.12 (2013-06-04)
+-------------------
+
+- be able to set zeo client as read only from buildout configuration
+  [vangheem]
+
+
+4.2.11 (2013-05-23)
+-------------------
+
+- When creating the blobstorage dir, make it only readable for the
+  current user, otherwise you get a ZODB warning on startup.  This
+  uses code from the ZODB, which does the same when Zope starts up and
+  the blobstorage directory does not exist yet.
+  [maurits]
+
+- Fixed check for empty custom_access_event_log and custom_event_log.
+  [alecghica]
+
+
+4.2.10 (2013-03-05)
+-------------------
+
+- Recipe would fail if eggs are stored in readonly cache. Don't copy
+  permissions from the egg.
+  [garbas]
+
+
+4.2.9 (2013-02-10)
+------------------
+
+- Add trove classifiers to note Python version compatibility.
+  [hannosch]
+
+
+4.2.8 (2013-01-17)
+------------------
+
+- Pass python flags to Zope interpreter as well. This prevents the debug
+  command from exiting directly.
+  [wichert]
+
+
+4.2.7 (2013-01-13)
+------------------
+
+- Load PYTHONSTARTUP if defined when running the debug command.
+  [mj]
+
+
+4.2.6 (2012-12-09)
+------------------
+
+- Use interpreter script instead of setting PYTHONPATH.  Fixes Windows
+  "the environment variable is longer than 32767 bytes" error.
+  [rossp]
+
+- Make the zope.conf http-server optional by setting http-address to
+  an empty string.  Useful for configurations used under an external
+  server such as a WSGI deployment.
+  [rossp]
+
+4.2.5 (2012-09-20)
+------------------
+
+- Added event and access log rotation capability.
+  [sureshvv]
+
+4.2.4 (2012-08-29)
+------------------
+
+- Expose 'drop-cache-rather-verify' ZEO client option which indicates that
+  the cache should be dropped rather than verified when the verification
+  optimization is not available (e.g. when the ZEO server restarted).
+  [runyaga]
+
+- Strip all empty lines out of zeo.conf to provide more compact view.
+  [runyaga]
+
+4.2.3 (2012-08-04)
+------------------
+
+- Fix zcml load order of the optional locales directory. Translation overrides
+  need to be loaded first.
+  [sunew]
+
+4.2.2 (2012-07-02)
+------------------
+
+- Changed client connection cache defaults. We specify a cache size of 30000
+  instead of 10000.
+  [hvelarde]
+
+- Add new `locales` option for specifying a locales directory with
+  extra or different translations.
+  [maurits]
+
+4.2.1 (2012-04-15)
+------------------
+
+- Add control script `debug` and `run` support to set up a REQUEST,
+  log in the AccessControl.SpecialUsers.system user, and traverse to
+  an object, such as a CMF portal.
+  [rpatterson]
+
+4.2 (2011-11-24)
+----------------
+
+- Add support for a changes storage for demo storage (in addition to
+  the base storage). Local file and blob storage is supported.
+  [malthe]
+
+- Add support for before storage (via the ``zc.beforestorage`` package).
+  [malthe]
+
+- Make script suppression optional (via empty `scripts` parameter). Otherwise,
+  scripts for packages listed in `eggs` parameter will be generated.
+  [aclark]
+
+- Support all RelStorage options, even future options. Used a simple pattern
+  to recognize where options should be placed: any option name containing a
+  dash is a generic option; the rest (except "name") are database-specific.
+  [hathawsh]
+
+4.1.9 - 2011-08-11
+------------------
+
+- No longer rely on `softwarehome` in startup script.
+  [hannosch]
+
+4.1.8 - 2011-07-17
+------------------
+
+- Add preliminary support for Zope 4.0, by re-using the skeleton for 2.13.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added `zeo-client-blob-cache-size` and `zeo-client-blob-cache-size-check`
+  options to control maximum size of blob cache, and when to check the size,
+  when using ClientStorage without shared blobs.
+  [davidjb]
+
+- If a resource directory is specified using `resources`, create it if it does
+  not yet exist.
+  [davisagli]
+
+- Support the new create-schema option introduced in RelStorage 1.5.0b2.
+  [mj]
+
+4.1.7 - 2011-06-07
+------------------
+
+- Renamed the optional ``998-resources.zcml`` (introduced in 4.1.6) to
+  ``998-resources-configure.zcml``, otherwise it does not get loaded
+  in the standard ``site.zcml``.
+  [maurits]
+
+
+4.1.6 - 2011-06-01
+------------------
+
+- Add new `resources` option for specifying a plone.resource central resource
+  directory.
+  [elro]
+
+4.1.5 - 2011-02-17
+------------------
+
+- Respect new `include-site-packages` buildout option introduced in buildout
+  1.5. Closes https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/716360.
+  [yuppie, hannosch]
+
+- Added option `import-directory` to point to custom import folder.
+  [garbas]
+
+4.1.4 - 2011-01-01
+------------------
+
+- Removed `zeo-client-name` option. The option had no effect since ZODB 3.2
+  and was removed in Zope 2.13. This closes
+  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/694920.
+  [hannosch]
+
+4.1.3 - 2010-12-20
+------------------
+
+- Added option http-force-connection-close which was only present in comment.
+  [tesdal]
+
+4.1.2 - 2010-12-05
+------------------
+
+- Fixed error introduced in 4.1.1.
+  [hannosch]
+
+4.1.1 - 2010-12-05
+------------------
+
+- Disambiguate the `blob-storage` option if `shared-blob` isn't used. In this
+  case we use `var/blobcache` as a default location, so we don't accidentally
+  overwrite the real blob data with a blob zeocache. Refs
+  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/645904.
+  [hannosch]
+
+4.1 - 2010-12-04
+----------------
+
+- Give the `readme` an overhaul, group options into sections and mention the
+  most commonly used ones at the top.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Add some flexibility to `site.zcml` creation. Thanks to Wolfgang Schnerring
+  for the patch. This closes
+  https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/335311.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Raise an exception if both ZEO and RelStorage are configured at the same
+  time. This closes https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/645100.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added support for zc.buildout 1.5, while retaining support for 1.4. Thanks
+  to Jeff Rush for the patch. This closes
+  https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/683584.
+  [hannosch]
+
+4.0.5 - 2010-10-22
+------------------
+
+- Added support for specifying the new RelStorage options shared-blob-dir,
+  blob-cache-size, blob-cache-size-check, and blob-chunk-size.
+  [hathawsh]
+
+4.0.4 - 2010-09-09
+------------------
+
+- Add friendly error message if non-admin tries
+  "instance install|start|restart|stop|remove".
+  [kleist]
+
+- Exit with the return code of the executed do_* method. This closes #10906
+  (clicking "Restart" in ZMI control panel caused shutdown).
+  [kleist]
+
+- Implemented the "restart" command for "bin/instance.exe".
+  [kleist]
+
+4.0.3 - 2010-08-20
+------------------
+
+- Setuptools / Subversion ignores empty directories and doesn't include them
+  into the source distribution. Added readme files to the `bin` and `var`
+  directories inside the skeleton. This lets persistent ZEO caches work again,
+  which want to put their files into the `var` directory.
+  [hannosch]
+
+4.0.2 - 2010-08-04
+------------------
+
+- Rewritten major parts of commands specific for the Windows Service, inspired
+  by "collective.buildout.cluster.base.ClusterBase" as used by the Windows
+  installer. Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10860.
+  [kleist]
+
+4.0.1 - 2010-07-30
+------------------
+
+- Use pid file to check for running application, instead of service status.
+  [sidnei]
+
+4.0.0 - 2010-07-21
+------------------
+
+- "console" mode on Windows no longer returns immediately, thus makes it
+  usable by the Windows Service.
+  [kleist]
+
+- Made tests compatible with Windows.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added support for specifying new RelStorage options cache-local-mb,
+  cache-delta-size-limit, commit-lock-timeout and commit-lock-id.
+  [hannosch]
+
+4.0b2 - 2010-06-23
+------------------
+
+- Added a new dependency on ``mailinglogger`` and expose it as a convenient
+  new option.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Removed testing dependency on ``zope.testing`` and refactored test setup.
+  [hannosch]
+
+4.0b1 - 2010-04-04
+------------------
+
+- The recipe could sometimes fail to build twice if no zcml option was given.
+  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10296.
+  [hannosch]
+
+4.0a4 - 2010-02-04
+------------------
+
+- Removed commented out options from the http-server section.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added new ``enable-product-installation`` option and let it default to off.
+  [hannosch]
+
+4.0a3 - 2010-01-24
+------------------
+
+- Tried to restore the Windows service functionality, getting closer but not
+  there yet all the way.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Use the same quoting approach for the console as for fg command on Windows.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Don't call zopectl.quote_command(), since the added outer double quotes caused
+  subprocess.call() to fail with "WindowsError: [Error 87] The parameter is
+  incorrect". Instead, hand roll the quoting (save outer quotes).
+  [kleist]
+
+- Un-hardcoded ':' as path separator, caused "ImportError: No module named
+  Zope2.Startup" on Windows. See http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9991.
+  [kleist]
+
+- Removed the import directory from the skeleton. You can place import files
+  into the import directory in the client home in new Zope 2 versions.
+  [hannosch, davisagli]
+
+- Make it possible to omit the user option, in which case buildout will ask
+  for a user and password, when a new instance is created.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Use our own make instance script and skeletons, only providing what we
+  really need anymore.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Merge the two ZopeCmd classes into one. We don't rely or generate the runzope
+  script or anything inside parts/instance/bin anymore.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- By default create a blob-storage in ``var/blobstorage``.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Removed the ``no-shell`` option and made it the default for running the
+  process. This also removes the need for the ``runzope`` script.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- This version can no longer be used to install a non-eggified Zope2. The
+  ``zope2-location`` option was removed.
+  [hannosch]
+
+4.0a2 - 2009-12-02
+------------------
+
+- Make it possible for third-party packages to add additional commands to the
+  control script by supplying a 'plone.recipe.zope2instance.ctl' entry point.
+  [davisagli]
+
+4.0a1 - 2009-11-14
+------------------
+
+- Removed the test command support from the control script which lets us
+  remove quite a bit of hackery. Added a note about using ``bin/test`` instead.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added an explicit `python-check-interval` option and change its default to
+  `1000` instead of Python's own default of `100`.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Changed default `zserver-threads` to two instead of four.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Changed client connection cache defaults. We specify a cache size of 10000
+  instead of 5000. Also changed ZEO client cache to 128MB instead of 30MB.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- If we are used in an environment with Zope2 as an egg, we make sure to
+  install the mkzopeinstance and runzope scripts we depend on ourselves.
+  This is done even if they already exist, since the eggs may have changed.
+  [hannosch, davisagli]
+
+- Added Zope2 egg to the list of dependencies of this recipe. This can cause
+  trouble for Zope versions before Zope 2.12 or Plone before 4.0.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added the cache-prefix option for RelStorage.
+
+3.6 (2009-10-11)
+----------------
+
+- Expanded the RelStorage options, including keep-history and replica-conf.
+  [hathawsh]
+
+3.5 (2009-09-05)
+----------------
+
+- Added support for relative-paths in the script generation.
+  [jvloothuis]
+
+- When `zope-conf` is set the config file will be directly loaded from that
+  location (it previously created a stub zope.conf which included it).
+  [jvloothuis]
+
+- Added an option to avoid using the normal shell scripts for starting Zope.
+  This makes it possible to avoid the hard-coded paths in these scripts.
+  [jvloothuis]
+
+- Allow the blob-dir parameter in RelStorage configurations.
+  [hathawsh]
+
+3.4 (2009-08-12)
+----------------
+
+- Support in line with fix for LP#407916.
+  [gotcha]
+
+- Changed the 'mkzopeinstance' call respect the 'bin-directory' option.
+  [esteele]
+
+- Removed the `zope2-egg` option and the simple startup script from the recipe.
+  We assume that we have an egg distribution if `zope2-location` is not set.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Merged the `davisagli-eggified-zope` branch into the trunk.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Add a new icp-address option. This is useful for environments where
+  e.g. squid is used to front a Zope/ZEO cluster. See
+  http://www.zope.org/Members/htrd/icp/intro
+  [neaj]
+
+3.3 - 2009-07-07
+----------------
+
+- Add handling for RelStorage options.
+  [elro]
+
+- Reinstall scripts on update which appears to be good recipe practice.
+  [stefan]
+
+3.2 - 2009-04-02
+----------------
+
+- Add a new zcml-additional option. This is useful for environments where
+  non-code configuration (such as database connection details for
+  ore.contentmirror) are managed through zcml.
+  [wichert]
+
+3.1 (2009-03-15)
+----------------
+
+- The 2.9 fix for spaces caused a problem using debug (bug 337740)
+  due to the way do_debug passed the "-i" command line argument
+  to get_startup_cmd.
+  [smcmahon]
+
+3.0 (2009-02-27)
+----------------
+
+- The 2.9 fix for the instance run command was itself broken and
+  would fail on anything except Windows.
+  [smcmahon]
+
+- Changed the `zope2-egg` option to omit any kind of instance creation for
+  now. The mkzopeinstance script relies on being able to import Zope2, which
+  is not available when buildout runs.
+  [hannosch]
+
+2.9 (2009-02-26)
+----------------
+
+- The instance run command was vulnerable to spaces in pathnames, and
+  needed some extra quoting for win32.
+  [smcmahon]
+
+- Check for existence of windows scripts before patching them. Some
+  Linux distributions of Zope2 don't have these files.
+  [smcmahon]
+
+- Delegate commands to ``win32serviceutil.HandleCommand()`` on win32,
+  instead of starting the interpreter through ``os.system()``. Should
+  shave off a couple seconds from overall time taken to process those
+  commands.
+  [sidnei]
+
+- Compute ``serviceClassString`` ourselves, since we are calling this
+  as a module and not directly as ``__main__``, otherwise the service
+  won't be installed correctly.
+  [sidnei]
+
+2.8 (2008-12-05)
+----------------
+
+- Add more tests for ZEO client with blob and demo storages.
+  Still no test on 'shared-blob-dir' option.
+  [encolpe]
+
+- Always use 'r'-style strings for passing script and configuration
+  filenames (eg: on 'instance run <script>').
+  [sidnei]
+
+- Add a demo-storage option and tests.
+  [encolpe]
+
+- Add a first test for blob-storage.
+  [encolpe]
+
+2.7 (2008-11-18)
+----------------
+
+- Added a `zope2-egg` option and an accompanying simple startup script for
+  use with an eggified Zope2.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Do not fail with a Zope2 egg checkout.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Normalize first argument to os.spawnl. It can get really upset
+  otherwise (dll import failure on a relocatable python install).
+  [sidnei]
+
+- Use same quoting as on 'do_foreground' for servicescript
+  usage. Fixes problems with installing the buildout-based Plone
+  installer for Windows on a path with spaces.
+  [sidnei]
+
+- Ensure that do_foreground leaves self.options.program arguments as it
+  found them.  This makes it possible to use 'fg' and 'debug' more than
+  once within the same control session.
+  [klm]
+
+2.6 (2008-10-22)
+----------------
+
+- Normalize, absolutize and lowercase-ize (is that a word?) paths
+  before comparing, to avoid problems with relative filenames and
+  different drive letter case on Windows.
+  [sidnei]
+
+2.5 (2008-09-22)
+----------------
+
+- Add support for zodb-cache-size-bytes from ZODB 3.9 and later.
+  [wichert]
+
+
+2.4 (2008-07-15)
+----------------
+
+- Introduced zope.conf variables "INSTANCEHOME" and "CLIENTHOME".
+  Its very very helpful in cluster setups with zope-conf-additional
+  sections (buildout lacks to reference the current section).
+  [jensens]
+
+- Made test command compatible with zope.testing 3.6.
+  [hannosch]
+
+2.3.1 (2008-06-10)
+------------------
+
+- No code changes. Released to fix the 2.3 release which put .egg files in
+  the wild.
+  [hannosch]
+
+2.3 (2008-06-06)
+----------------
+
+- Need to actually pass in deprecation-warnings, otherwise we get a
+  KeyError.
+  [sidnei]
+
+- Fix another place where the directory name needed to be escaped to
+  avoid problems with spaces.
+  [sidnei]
+
+- Don't try to delete location if it does not exist.
+  [sidnei]
+
+2.2 (2008-06-06)
+----------------
+
+- Added `deprecation-warnings` option that allows turning the option
+  to disable deprecation warnings on or off. You can provide the value
+  `error` to it, and every deprecation warning will be turned into an
+  exception.
+  [sidnei]
+
+- Fix copy and paste error that caused a failure on changing
+  runzope.bat to call servicewrapper.py.
+  [sidnei]
+
+- Escape 'executable' argument before passing it to os.spawnl, in
+  order to make it work on Windows when the executable name has spaces
+  on it.
+  [sidnei]
+
+- Added `http-fast-listen` option. Use of this option requires Zope >= 2.11.
+  [stefan]
+
+2.1 (2008-06-05)
+----------------
+
+- Fixed a test problem on Windows, where explicit closing of files is required.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Call `servicewrapper.py` from `runzope.bat` instead of setting
+  `PYTHONPATH` and calling `Zope2/Startup/run.py`. That way we set
+  sys.path from inside Python code and avoid exceeding the maximum
+  environment variable limit.
+  [sidnei]
+
+- Allow to use an alternative temporary storage, by specifying the new
+  `zodb-temporary-storage` option.
+  [jensens]
+
+- Added `environment-vars` option to set environment variables. Changed
+  the zope-conf-additional example code to something that isn't covered by
+  the recipe.
+  [claytron]
+
+2.0 (2008-05-29)
+----------------
+
+- Do not use system but exec when starting Zope. This makes it possible for
+  process management tools to properly manage Zope processes.
+  [wichert]
+
+- Added `site-zcml` option
+  Added tests
+  [mustapha]
+
+- Add support for ZEO authentication. Note that this does not work with any
+  released Zope or ZODB version at this moment. See
+  http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope/2005-October/161951.html for required
+  patches.
+  [wichert]
+
+- Added FTP and WebDAV options
+  [claytron]
+
+- Allow rel-storage to be an empty string, meaning 'do not use relstorage'.
+  This allows an extending buildout configuration to disable relstorage again.
+  [mj]
+
+1.9 (2008-04-15)
+----------------
+
+- Fix rel-storage parsing for options with spaces. Note that split() or
+  split(None) already strips the string.
+  [mj]
+
+1.8 (2008-04-05)
+----------------
+
+- Fixed a Win32 problem in which the presence of Python string escapes in the
+  path to zope.conf (e.g., d:\botest\parts\instance\etc\zope.conf would escape
+  the \b). This showed up when using the 'run', 'debug' or 'adduser' commands.
+  This fixes #211416.
+  [smcmahon]
+
+- Added `console` command to the instance script, which is equivalent to fg but
+  does not implicitly turn on debug mode but respects the zope.conf setting.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.7 (2008-03-31)
+----------------
+
+- Added new client-home option and let it default to a subfolder of the
+  buildout-wide var folder with a subfolder of the name of the section.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added limited support for running tests under Zope <= 2.8.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.6 (2008-03-27)
+----------------
+
+- Fixed runzope script generation for Zope 2.8.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Cleaned up "./bin/instance test" option handling.
+  [stefan]
+
+- Removed generator expressions as these aren't supported in < py2.4, which is
+  used by zope 2.7/8.
+  [duffyd]
+
+1.5 (2008-02-29)
+----------------
+
+- Added `access-log-custom` option to be able to use another event logger
+  than the file one for the access logger.
+  [tarek]
+
+- Fix instance generation to work on Windows with blanks in the path name.
+  This closes #188023.
+  [hannosch, gotti]
+
+- Added 'zeo-client-client' option which results in 'client <value>' inside
+  <zeoclient>.
+  [timte, hannosch]
+
+- Made relstorage handling more generic, so it now supports any RelStorage
+  adapter, including Oracle (which was broken).
+  [mj]
+
+1.4 (2008-02-23)
+----------------
+
+- Fix typo in event log parameter name (from "z-log" to "z2-log"), to comply
+  with the documentation. This closes #190943.
+  [kdeldycke]
+
+- Create pid and lock file folders if they don't exist.
+  [kdeldycke]
+
+- Remove hard-coded log level and use the event_log_level parameter to set it
+  dynamically. This closes #190994.
+  [kdeldycke]
+
+- Added a test environment, using zc.buildout.testing, and a doctest that
+  tries the recipe.
+  [tarek]
+
+- Added an `event-log-custom` option
+  [tarek]
+
+- Added example for the zope-conf-additional option. This closes #185539.
+  [klm, hannosch]
+
+- Added `rel-storage` option to be able to wire Zope to RelStorage
+  (postgresql/oracle) instead of a FileStorage database.
+  [tarek]
+
+1.3
+---
+
+- For each entry in recipe-specified 'extra-paths' line, add a 'path' line
+  to the instance and Zope client zope.conf files.
+  [klm]
+
+1.2
+---
+
+- Added the boolean `shared-blob` option, defaulting to `no`. If all of
+  `zeo-client`, `blob-storage` and `shared-blob` options are set,
+  the instance will assume the blob directory set by `blob-storage` is shared
+  with the server instead of streaming 'blob' files through the ZEO connection.
+  [rochael]
+
+- Changed `ctl.do_foreground()` (which is invoked by the `fg` command
+  line argument) start Zope in debug mode to emulate the behavior of
+  `zopectl fg`. This required a little special WIN32 code to make
+  sure it would work in both `*nix` and Windows.
+  [smcmahon]
+
+- Added `var` option, which is used to configure the base directory for all
+  the things going into var.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added `zeo-var` option, which is used in the zeo storage snippets to
+  configure the zeo var folder.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Merged rochael-blobsupport branch. Added support for ZODB 3.8 blob storage
+  configuration for ZEO clients. This references
+  https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/179113.
+  [rochael, hannosch]
+
+- Added `zeo-client-name` option. Defaults to the name of the ZEO client.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.1
+---
+
+- Small documentation update. Added link to the bugtracker.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Changed default of zope.conf option 'default-zpublisher-encoding' to 'utf-8'
+  instead of Zope's default value of 'iso-8859-15'.
+
+- Have PID file's location default to '${buildout:directory}/var/${name}.pid'.
+  Keeping the PID file in $INSTANCE_HOME gives trouble when buildout rebuilds
+  the part.
+  [nouri, mustapha]
+
+1.0
+---
+
+- Increased 'zodb_cache_size' default value to 5000, which is more likely a
+  better default these days.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added support for 'extra-paths' as in 'zc.recipe.egg'; this is useful when
+  using regular python packages for which no eggs are available (yet), i.e.
+  with 'plone.recipe.distros'.
+  [witsch]
+
+- Added zeo-storage option (merge branch ree-add-zeo-storage-option).
+  [ree]
+
+- Avoid doubled entries to eggs specified in the buildout in 'sys.path':
+  the working set ('ws') gets passed again when installing the script
+  ('bin/instance'), but it is not also added to 'extra_paths'.
+  [witsch]
+
+- Patching 'PYTHONPATH' in the Zope startup skripts should insert all
+  additional paths (to eggs) __before__ 'SOFTWARE_HOME', because otherwise
+  (newer) egg versions of components from the standard Zope distribution
+  (i.e. stuff that lives in 'lib/python') cannot be used.
+  [witsch]
+
+- Changed the option to suppress deprecation warnings to "--nowarn" or
+  '--nowarning" to be consistent with "zopectl test".
+  [witsch]
+
+- Added option "-w" to allow the test runner to suppress deprecation warnings,
+  so it's easier to spot failing tests...
+  [witsch]
+
+- Updated import for Zope 2.7 (and below) compatibility.
+  [duffyd]
+
+- Merging -r51966:52659 claytron-zopeconfoptions branch to trunk.
+  [claytron]
+
+- Made the config snippet prettier while still getting the resulting
+  indentation right.
+  [witsch]
+
+0.9
+---
+
+- Added support for zodb 3.8's "<blobstorage>" directive.
+  [witsch]
+
+- Added a script name arg before callint zope.testing.testrunner.run.
+  zope.testing.testrunner:1772, get_options removes the first arg from
+  the list of arguments expecting a script name there. Was causing
+  "bin/instance test" to behave improperly.
+  [rossp]
+
+0.8
+---
+
+- Use bin if present falling back to utilities. This makes it possible to use
+  a Zope version installed from a tarball and not compiled inplace.
+  [rossp]
+
+0.7
+---
+
+- Found the problem with strange environment variables.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Fixed documentation bug, the cache size is respected by non-zeo instance as
+  well.
+  [hannosch]
+
+0.6
+---
+
+- J1m actually read the docs ;)
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Attempt to fix the sometimes insane number of tests which are found by the
+  test runner.
+  [hannosch]
+
+0.5
+---
+
+- Added an option to set the effective-user.
+  [optilude]
+
+0.4
+---
+
+- Generate a bin/repozo script to perform backups using repozo.py (and
+  set up the appropriate pythonpath for this to work).
+  [optilude]
+
+- Document options properly, and add the ability to specify a zope.conf
+  file explicitly rather than having one generated from a template.
+  [optilude]
+
+0.3
+---
+
+- Finally found a way to provide the Zope Windows service with the right
+  environment. We need a new wrapper script, which sets up the PYTHONPATH.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Make it possible to configure the name of the zopectl script using the
+  control-script option in the [instance] section.
+  [wichert]
+
+0.2
+---
+
+- Extend support for zcml slugs to include Zope 2.9.
+  [dunny]
+
+- Added support for making a ZEO-client.
+  [regebro]
+
+0.1
+---
+
+- Initial implementation.
+  [hannosch]

-  [gforcada]
-
-
-4.2.18 (2015-07-27)
--------------------

-  disable the Z2 access log.  Set ``event-log`` to the value
-  ``disable`` to disable the event log.
-  [frapell]
-

-  [ivant]
-
-
-4.2.14 (2014-03-02)

-
-
-4.2.11 (2013-05-23)
--------------------
-
-- When creating the blobstorage dir, make it only readable for the
-  current user, otherwise you get a ZODB warning on startup.  This
-  uses code from the ZODB, which does the same when Zope starts up and
-  the blobstorage directory does not exist yet.
-  [maurits]
-
-- Fixed check for empty custom_access_event_log and custom_event_log.
-  [alecghica]

-------------------
-
-- Load PYTHONSTARTUP if defined when running the debug command.
-  [mj]
-
-
-4.2.6 (2012-12-09)
-------------------
-
-- Use interpreter script instead of setting PYTHONPATH.  Fixes Windows
-  "the environment variable is longer than 32767 bytes" error.
-  [rossp]
-

-- Added event and access log rotation capability.
-  [sureshvv]
-
-4.2.4 (2012-08-29)
-------------------
-
-- Expose 'drop-cache-rather-verify' ZEO client option which indicates that
-  the cache should be dropped rather than verified when the verification
-  optimization is not available (e.g. when the ZEO server restarted).
-  [runyaga]
-
-- Strip all empty lines out of zeo.conf to provide more compact view.
-  [runyaga]
-
-4.2.3 (2012-08-04)

-  extra or different translations.
-  [maurits]
-
-4.2.1 (2012-04-15)
-------------------
-
-- Add control script `debug` and `run` support to set up a REQUEST,
-  log in the AccessControl.SpecialUsers.system user, and traverse to
-  an object, such as a CMF portal.
-  [rpatterson]
-
-4.2 (2011-11-24)
-----------------
-
-- Add support for a changes storage for demo storage (in addition to
-  the base storage). Local file and blob storage is supported.
-  [malthe]
-
-- Add support for before storage (via the ``zc.beforestorage`` package).
-  [malthe]
-
-- Make script suppression optional (via empty `scripts` parameter). Otherwise,
-  scripts for packages listed in `eggs` parameter will be generated.
-  [aclark]
-
-- Support all RelStorage options, even future options. Used a simple pattern
-  to recognize where options should be placed: any option name containing a
-  dash is a generic option; the rest (except "name") are database-specific.
-  [hathawsh]
-
-4.1.9 - 2011-08-11
-------------------
-
-- No longer rely on `softwarehome` in startup script.
-  [hannosch]
-
-4.1.8 - 2011-07-17
-------------------
-
-- Add preliminary support for Zope 4.0, by re-using the skeleton for 2.13.
-  [hannosch]
-

-  options to control maximum size of blob cache, and when to check the size,
-  when using ClientStorage without shared blobs.
-  [davidjb]
-
-- If a resource directory is specified using `resources`, create it if it does
-  not yet exist.
-  [davisagli]
-
-- Support the new create-schema option introduced in RelStorage 1.5.0b2.
-  [mj]
-
-4.1.7 - 2011-06-07
-------------------
-
-- Renamed the optional ``998-resources.zcml`` (introduced in 4.1.6) to
-  ``998-resources-configure.zcml``, otherwise it does not get loaded
-  in the standard ``site.zcml``.
-  [maurits]
-
-
-4.1.6 - 2011-06-01
-------------------
-
-- Add new `resources` option for specifying a plone.resource central resource
-  directory.
-  [elro]
-
-4.1.5 - 2011-02-17
-------------------
-
-- Respect new `include-site-packages` buildout option introduced in buildout
-  1.5. Closes https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/716360.
-  [yuppie, hannosch]
-
-- Added option `import-directory` to point to custom import folder.
-  [garbas]
-
-4.1.4 - 2011-01-01
-------------------
-
-- Removed `zeo-client-name` option. The option had no effect since ZODB 3.2
-  and was removed in Zope 2.13. This closes
-  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/694920.
-  [hannosch]
-
-4.1.3 - 2010-12-20
-------------------
-
-- Added option http-force-connection-close which was only present in comment.
-  [tesdal]
-
-4.1.2 - 2010-12-05
-------------------
-
-- Fixed error introduced in 4.1.1.
-  [hannosch]
-
-4.1.1 - 2010-12-05
-------------------
-
-- Disambiguate the `blob-storage` option if `shared-blob` isn't used. In this
-  case we use `var/blobcache` as a default location, so we don't accidentally
-  overwrite the real blob data with a blob zeocache. Refs
-  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/645904.
-  [hannosch]
-
-4.1 - 2010-12-04
-----------------
-
-- Give the `readme` an overhaul, group options into sections and mention the
-  most commonly used ones at the top.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Add some flexibility to `site.zcml` creation. Thanks to Wolfgang Schnerring
-  for the patch. This closes
-  https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/335311.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Raise an exception if both ZEO and RelStorage are configured at the same
-  time. This closes https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/645100.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Added support for zc.buildout 1.5, while retaining support for 1.4. Thanks
-  to Jeff Rush for the patch. This closes
-  https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/683584.
-  [hannosch]
-
-4.0.5 - 2010-10-22
-------------------
-
-- Added support for specifying the new RelStorage options shared-blob-dir,
-  blob-cache-size, blob-cache-size-check, and blob-chunk-size.
-  [hathawsh]
-
-4.0.4 - 2010-09-09
-------------------
-
-- Add friendly error message if non-admin tries
-  "instance install|start|restart|stop|remove".
-  [kleist]
-
-- Exit with the return code of the executed do_* method. This closes #10906
-  (clicking "Restart" in ZMI control panel caused shutdown).
-  [kleist]
-
-- Implemented the "restart" command for "bin/instance.exe".
-  [kleist]
-
-4.0.3 - 2010-08-20
-------------------
-
-- Setuptools / Subversion ignores empty directories and doesn't include them
-  into the source distribution. Added readme files to the `bin` and `var`
-  directories inside the skeleton. This lets persistent ZEO caches work again,
-  which want to put their files into the `var` directory.
-  [hannosch]
-
-4.0.2 - 2010-08-04
-------------------
-
-- Rewritten major parts of commands specific for the Windows Service, inspired
-  by "collective.buildout.cluster.base.ClusterBase" as used by the Windows
-  installer. Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10860.
-  [kleist]
-
-4.0.1 - 2010-07-30
-------------------
-
-- Use pid file to check for running application, instead of service status.
-  [sidnei]
-
-4.0.0 - 2010-07-21
-------------------
-
-- "console" mode on Windows no longer returns immediately, thus makes it
-  usable by the Windows Service.
-  [kleist]
-
-- Made tests compatible with Windows.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Added support for specifying new RelStorage options cache-local-mb,
-  cache-delta-size-limit, commit-lock-timeout and commit-lock-id.
-  [hannosch]
-
-4.0b2 - 2010-06-23
-------------------
-
-- Added a new dependency on ``mailinglogger`` and expose it as a convenient
-  new option.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Removed testing dependency on ``zope.testing`` and refactored test setup.
-  [hannosch]
-
-4.0b1 - 2010-04-04
-------------------
-
-- The recipe could sometimes fail to build twice if no zcml option was given.
-  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10296.
-  [hannosch]
-
-4.0a4 - 2010-02-04
-------------------
-
-- Removed commented out options from the http-server section.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Added new ``enable-product-installation`` option and let it default to off.
-  [hannosch]
-
-4.0a3 - 2010-01-24
-------------------
-
-- Tried to restore the Windows service functionality, getting closer but not
-  there yet all the way.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Use the same quoting approach for the console as for fg command on Windows.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Don't call zopectl.quote_command(), since the added outer double quotes caused
-  subprocess.call() to fail with "WindowsError: [Error 87] The parameter is
-  incorrect". Instead, hand roll the quoting (save outer quotes).
-  [kleist]
-
-- Un-hardcoded ':' as path separator, caused "ImportError: No module named
-  Zope2.Startup" on Windows. See http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9991.
-  [kleist]
-
-- Removed the import directory from the skeleton. You can place import files
-  into the import directory in the client home in new Zope 2 versions.
-  [hannosch, davisagli]
-
-- Make it possible to omit the user option, in which case buildout will ask
-  for a user and password, when a new instance is created.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Use our own make instance script and skeletons, only providing what we
-  really need anymore.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Merge the two ZopeCmd classes into one. We don't rely or generate the runzope
-  script or anything inside parts/instance/bin anymore.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- By default create a blob-storage in ``var/blobstorage``.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Removed the ``no-shell`` option and made it the default for running the
-  process. This also removes the need for the ``runzope`` script.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- This version can no longer be used to install a non-eggified Zope2. The
-  ``zope2-location`` option was removed.
-  [hannosch]
-
-4.0a2 - 2009-12-02
-------------------
-
-- Make it possible for third-party packages to add additional commands to the
-  control script by supplying a 'plone.recipe.zope2instance.ctl' entry point.
-  [davisagli]
-
-4.0a1 - 2009-11-14
-------------------
-
-- Removed the test command support from the control script which lets us
-  remove quite a bit of hackery. Added a note about using ``bin/test`` instead.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Added an explicit `python-check-interval` option and change its default to
-  `1000` instead of Python's own default of `100`.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Changed default `zserver-threads` to two instead of four.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Changed client connection cache defaults. We specify a cache size of 10000
-  instead of 5000. Also changed ZEO client cache to 128MB instead of 30MB.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- If we are used in an environment with Zope2 as an egg, we make sure to
-  install the mkzopeinstance and runzope scripts we depend on ourselves.
-  This is done even if they already exist, since the eggs may have changed.
-  [hannosch, davisagli]
-
-- Added Zope2 egg to the list of dependencies of this recipe. This can cause
-  trouble for Zope versions before Zope 2.12 or Plone before 4.0.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Added the cache-prefix option for RelStorage.
-
-3.6 (2009-10-11)
-----------------
-
-- Expanded the RelStorage options, including keep-history and replica-conf.
-  [hathawsh]
-
-3.5 (2009-09-05)
-----------------
-
-- Added support for relative-paths in the script generation.
-  [jvloothuis]
-
-- When `zope-conf` is set the config file will be directly loaded from that
-  location (it previously created a stub zope.conf which included it).
-  [jvloothuis]
-
-- Added an option to avoid using the normal shell scripts for starting Zope.
-  This makes it possible to avoid the hard-coded paths in these scripts.
-  [jvloothuis]
-
-- Allow the blob-dir parameter in RelStorage configurations.
-  [hathawsh]
-
-3.4 (2009-08-12)
-----------------
-
-- Support in line with fix for LP#407916.
-  [gotcha]
-
-- Changed the 'mkzopeinstance' call respect the 'bin-directory' option.
-  [esteele]
-
-- Removed the `zope2-egg` option and the simple startup script from the recipe.
-  We assume that we have an egg distribution if `zope2-location` is not set.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Merged the `davisagli-eggified-zope` branch into the trunk.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Add a new icp-address option. This is useful for environments where
-  e.g. squid is used to front a Zope/ZEO cluster. See
-  http://www.zope.org/Members/htrd/icp/intro
-  [neaj]
-
-3.3 - 2009-07-07
-----------------
-
-- Add handling for RelStorage options.
-  [elro]
-
-- Reinstall scripts on update which appears to be good recipe practice.
-  [stefan]
-
-3.2 - 2009-04-02
-----------------
-
-- Add a new zcml-additional option. This is useful for environments where
-  non-code configuration (such as database connection details for
-  ore.contentmirror) are managed through zcml.
-  [wichert]
-
-3.1 (2009-03-15)
-----------------
-
-- The 2.9 fix for spaces caused a problem using debug (bug 337740)
-  due to the way do_debug passed the "-i" command line argument
-  to get_startup_cmd.
-  [smcmahon]
-
-3.0 (2009-02-27)
-----------------
-
-- The 2.9 fix for the instance run command was itself broken and
-  would fail on anything except Windows.
-  [smcmahon]
-
-- Changed the `zope2-egg` option to omit any kind of instance creation for
-  now. The mkzopeinstance script relies on being able to import Zope2, which
-  is not available when buildout runs.
-  [hannosch]
-
-2.9 (2009-02-26)
-----------------
-
-- The instance run command was vulnerable to spaces in pathnames, and
-  needed some extra quoting for win32.
-  [smcmahon]
-
-- Check for existence of windows scripts before patching them. Some
-  Linux distributions of Zope2 don't have these files.
-  [smcmahon]
-
-- Delegate commands to ``win32serviceutil.HandleCommand()`` on win32,
-  instead of starting the interpreter through ``os.system()``. Should
-  shave off a couple seconds from overall time taken to process those
-  commands.
-  [sidnei]
-
-- Compute ``serviceClassString`` ourselves, since we are calling this
-  as a module and not directly as ``__main__``, otherwise the service
-  won't be installed correctly.
-  [sidnei]
-
-2.8 (2008-12-05)
-----------------
-
-- Add more tests for ZEO client with blob and demo storages.
-  Still no test on 'shared-blob-dir' option.
-  [encolpe]
-
-- Always use 'r'-style strings for passing script and configuration
-  filenames (eg: on 'instance run <script>').
-  [sidnei]
-
-- Add a demo-storage option and tests.
-  [encolpe]
-
-- Add a first test for blob-storage.
-  [encolpe]
-
-2.7 (2008-11-18)
-----------------
-
-- Added a `zope2-egg` option and an accompanying simple startup script for
-  use with an eggified Zope2.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Do not fail with a Zope2 egg checkout.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Normalize first argument to os.spawnl. It can get really upset
-  otherwise (dll import failure on a relocatable python install).
-  [sidnei]
-
-- Use same quoting as on 'do_foreground' for servicescript
-  usage. Fixes problems with installing the buildout-based Plone
-  installer for Windows on a path with spaces.
-  [sidnei]
-
-- Ensure that do_foreground leaves self.options.program arguments as it
-  found them.  This makes it possible to use 'fg' and 'debug' more than
-  once within the same control session.
-  [klm]
-
-2.6 (2008-10-22)
-----------------
-
-- Normalize, absolutize and lowercase-ize (is that a word?) paths
-  before comparing, to avoid problems with relative filenames and
-  different drive letter case on Windows.
-  [sidnei]
-
-2.5 (2008-09-22)
-----------------
-
-- Add support for zodb-cache-size-bytes from ZODB 3.9 and later.
-  [wichert]
-
-
-2.4 (2008-07-15)
-----------------
-
-- Introduced zope.conf variables "INSTANCEHOME" and "CLIENTHOME".
-  Its very very helpful in cluster setups with zope-conf-additional
-  sections (buildout lacks to reference the current section).
-  [jensens]
-
-- Made test command compatible with zope.testing 3.6.
-  [hannosch]
-
-2.3.1 (2008-06-10)
-------------------
-
-- No code changes. Released to fix the 2.3 release which put .egg files in
-  the wild.
-  [hannosch]
-
-2.3 (2008-06-06)
-----------------
-
-- Need to actually pass in deprecation-warnings, otherwise we get a
-  KeyError.
-  [sidnei]
-
-- Fix another place where the directory name needed to be escaped to
-  avoid problems with spaces.
-  [sidnei]
-
-- Don't try to delete location if it does not exist.
-  [sidnei]
-
-2.2 (2008-06-06)
-----------------
-
-- Added `deprecation-warnings` option that allows turning the option
-  to disable deprecation warnings on or off. You can provide the value
-  `error` to it, and every deprecation warning will be turned into an
-  exception.
-  [sidnei]
-
-- Fix copy and paste error that caused a failure on changing
-  runzope.bat to call servicewrapper.py.
-  [sidnei]
-
-- Escape 'executable' argument before passing it to os.spawnl, in
-  order to make it work on Windows when the executable name has spaces
-  on it.
-  [sidnei]
-
-- Added `http-fast-listen` option. Use of this option requires Zope >= 2.11.
-  [stefan]
-
-2.1 (2008-06-05)
-----------------
-
-- Fixed a test problem on Windows, where explicit closing of files is required.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Call `servicewrapper.py` from `runzope.bat` instead of setting
-  `PYTHONPATH` and calling `Zope2/Startup/run.py`. That way we set
-  sys.path from inside Python code and avoid exceeding the maximum
-  environment variable limit.
-  [sidnei]
-
-- Allow to use an alternative temporary storage, by specifying the new
-  `zodb-temporary-storage` option.
-  [jensens]
-
-- Added `environment-vars` option to set environment variables. Changed
-  the zope-conf-additional example code to something that isn't covered by
-  the recipe.
-  [claytron]
-
-2.0 (2008-05-29)
-----------------
-
-- Do not use system but exec when starting Zope. This makes it possible for
-  process management tools to properly manage Zope processes.
-  [wichert]
-
-- Added `site-zcml` option
-  Added tests
-  [mustapha]
-
-- Add support for ZEO authentication. Note that this does not work with any
-  released Zope or ZODB version at this moment. See
-  http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope/2005-October/161951.html for required
-  patches.
-  [wichert]
-
-- Added FTP and WebDAV options
-  [claytron]
-
-- Allow rel-storage to be an empty string, meaning 'do not use relstorage'.
-  This allows an extending buildout configuration to disable relstorage again.
-  [mj]
-
-1.9 (2008-04-15)
-----------------
-
-- Fix rel-storage parsing for options with spaces. Note that split() or
-  split(None) already strips the string.
-  [mj]
-
-1.8 (2008-04-05)
-----------------
-
-- Fixed a Win32 problem in which the presence of Python string escapes in the
-  path to zope.conf (e.g., d:\botest\parts\instance\etc\zope.conf would escape
-  the \b). This showed up when using the 'run', 'debug' or 'adduser' commands.
-  This fixes #211416.
-  [smcmahon]
-
-- Added `console` command to the instance script, which is equivalent to fg but
-  does not implicitly turn on debug mode but respects the zope.conf setting.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.7 (2008-03-31)
-----------------
-
-- Added new client-home option and let it default to a subfolder of the
-  buildout-wide var folder with a subfolder of the name of the section.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Added limited support for running tests under Zope <= 2.8.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.6 (2008-03-27)
-----------------
-
-- Fixed runzope script generation for Zope 2.8.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Cleaned up "./bin/instance test" option handling.
-  [stefan]
-
-- Removed generator expressions as these aren't supported in < py2.4, which is
-  used by zope 2.7/8.
-  [duffyd]
-
-1.5 (2008-02-29)
-----------------
-
-- Added `access-log-custom` option to be able to use another event logger
-  than the file one for the access logger.
-  [tarek]
-
-- Fix instance generation to work on Windows with blanks in the path name.
-  This closes #188023.
-  [hannosch, gotti]
-
-- Added 'zeo-client-client' option which results in 'client <value>' inside
-  <zeoclient>.
-  [timte, hannosch]
-
-- Made relstorage handling more generic, so it now supports any RelStorage
-  adapter, including Oracle (which was broken).
-  [mj]
-
-1.4 (2008-02-23)
-----------------
-
-- Fix typo in event log parameter name (from "z-log" to "z2-log"), to comply
-  with the documentation. This closes #190943.
-  [kdeldycke]
-
-- Create pid and lock file folders if they don't exist.
-  [kdeldycke]
-
-- Remove hard-coded log level and use the event_log_level parameter to set it
-  dynamically. This closes #190994.
-  [kdeldycke]
-
-- Added a test environment, using zc.buildout.testing, and a doctest that
-  tries the recipe.
-  [tarek]
-
-- Added an `event-log-custom` option
-  [tarek]
-
-- Added example for the zope-conf-additional option. This closes #185539.
-  [klm, hannosch]
-
-- Added `rel-storage` option to be able to wire Zope to RelStorage
-  (postgresql/oracle) instead of a FileStorage database.
-  [tarek]
-
-1.3
----
-
-- For each entry in recipe-specified 'extra-paths' line, add a 'path' line
-  to the instance and Zope client zope.conf files.
-  [klm]
-
-1.2
----
-
-- Added the boolean `shared-blob` option, defaulting to `no`. If all of
-  `zeo-client`, `blob-storage` and `shared-blob` options are set,
-  the instance will assume the blob directory set by `blob-storage` is shared
-  with the server instead of streaming 'blob' files through the ZEO connection.
-  [rochael]
-
-- Changed `ctl.do_foreground()` (which is invoked by the `fg` command
-  line argument) start Zope in debug mode to emulate the behavior of
-  `zopectl fg`. This required a little special WIN32 code to make
-  sure it would work in both `*nix` and Windows.
-  [smcmahon]
-
-- Added `var` option, which is used to configure the base directory for all
-  the things going into var.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Added `zeo-var` option, which is used in the zeo storage snippets to
-  configure the zeo var folder.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Merged rochael-blobsupport branch. Added support for ZODB 3.8 blob storage
-  configuration for ZEO clients. This references
-  https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/179113.
-  [rochael, hannosch]
-
-- Added `zeo-client-name` option. Defaults to the name of the ZEO client.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.1
----
-
-- Small documentation update. Added link to the bugtracker.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Changed default of zope.conf option 'default-zpublisher-encoding' to 'utf-8'
-  instead of Zope's default value of 'iso-8859-15'.
-
-- Have PID file's location default to '${buildout:directory}/var/${name}.pid'.
-  Keeping the PID file in $INSTANCE_HOME gives trouble when buildout rebuilds
-  the part.
-  [nouri, mustapha]
-
-1.0
----
-
-- Increased 'zodb_cache_size' default value to 5000, which is more likely a
-  better default these days.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Added support for 'extra-paths' as in 'zc.recipe.egg'; this is useful when
-  using regular python packages for which no eggs are available (yet), i.e.
-  with 'plone.recipe.distros'.
-  [witsch]
-
-- Added zeo-storage option (merge branch ree-add-zeo-storage-option).
-  [ree]
-
-- Avoid doubled entries to eggs specified in the buildout in 'sys.path':
-  the working set ('ws') gets passed again when installing the script
-  ('bin/instance'), but it is not also added to 'extra_paths'.
-  [witsch]
-
-- Patching 'PYTHONPATH' in the Zope startup skripts should insert all
-  additional paths (to eggs) __before__ 'SOFTWARE_HOME', because otherwise
-  (newer) egg versions of components from the standard Zope distribution
-  (i.e. stuff that lives in 'lib/python') cannot be used.
-  [witsch]
-
-- Changed the option to suppress deprecation warnings to "--nowarn" or
-  '--nowarning" to be consistent with "zopectl test".
-  [witsch]
-
-- Added option "-w" to allow the test runner to suppress deprecation warnings,
-  so it's easier to spot failing tests...
-  [witsch]
-
-- Updated import for Zope 2.7 (and below) compatibility.
-  [duffyd]
-
-- Merging -r51966:52659 claytron-zopeconfoptions branch to trunk.
-  [claytron]
-
-- Made the config snippet prettier while still getting the resulting
-  indentation right.
-  [witsch]
-
-0.9
----
-
-- Added support for zodb 3.8's "<blobstorage>" directive.
-  [witsch]
-
-- Added a script name arg before callint zope.testing.testrunner.run.
-  zope.testing.testrunner:1772, get_options removes the first arg from
-  the list of arguments expecting a script name there. Was causing
-  "bin/instance test" to behave improperly.
-  [rossp]
-
-0.8
----
-
-- Use bin if present falling back to utilities. This makes it possible to use
-  a Zope version installed from a tarball and not compiled inplace.
-  [rossp]
-
-0.7
----
-
-- Found the problem with strange environment variables.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Fixed documentation bug, the cache size is respected by non-zeo instance as
-  well.
-  [hannosch]
-
-0.6
----
-
-- J1m actually read the docs ;)
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Attempt to fix the sometimes insane number of tests which are found by the
-  test runner.
-  [hannosch]
-
-0.5
----
-
-- Added an option to set the effective-user.
-  [optilude]
-
-0.4
----
-
-- Generate a bin/repozo script to perform backups using repozo.py (and
-  set up the appropriate pythonpath for this to work).
-  [optilude]
-
-- Document options properly, and add the ability to specify a zope.conf
-  file explicitly rather than having one generated from a template.
-  [optilude]
-
-0.3
----
-
-- Finally found a way to provide the Zope Windows service with the right
-  environment. We need a new wrapper script, which sets up the PYTHONPATH.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Make it possible to configure the name of the zopectl script using the
-  control-script option in the [instance] section.
-  [wichert]
-
-0.2
----
-
-- Extend support for zcml slugs to include Zope 2.9.
-  [dunny]
-
-- Added support for making a ZEO-client.
-  [regebro]
-
-0.1
----
-
-- Initial implementation.
