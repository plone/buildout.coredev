+  [khink]

+- Make some methods of TypesWidget unpublishable.
+  [davisagli]

+  [jfroche]
+
+
+1.9.0 (2013-05-23)
+------------------
+

+
+- Provide sane defaults for minute_step, which is an integer
+  everywhere else.

+
+1.8.5 (2012-11-15)
+------------------
+
+- Disallow downloading files via the at_download script if the user does not

+  [davisagli]
+
+- Add minute_step to CalendarWidget so we can define another minute step than

+----------------
+
+- PEP 8 (ignoring W602, W604, E231, E241, E301, E302, E501 and E701).

+
+- Remove remaining hard-coded required markers. The 1.7.14 change only got
+  one of them.
+  [smcmahon]
+
+- Moved form help from a div after form field labels to a span within. The
+  purpose is to semantically associate the label to the form help so that
+  it's more useful to a screen reader user.
+  Note that sunburst's public.css and classic's form.css.dtml were
+  simultaneously changed to assure block display of help in normal
+  font-weight.
+  Closes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/7212, an accessibility ticket.
+  [smcmahon]
+
+- Deprecated aliases were replaced on tests.
+  [hvelarde]
+
+
+1.7.14 (2012-05-07)

+  [zopyx]
+
+
+1.7.13 (2012-04-09)
+-------------------
+
+- Make sure inline editing calls target the
+  id="parent-fieldname-$fieldName-$UID" on text fields.
+  Closes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12465
+  [esteele]
+
+- Fixed the KeywordWidget template and JavaScript source. the widget can
+  now be used for fields with name different from "subject". Also multiple
+  istances of this field can be used in the same page.
+  See http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12218
+  [keul]
+
+1.7.12 (2012-02-07)
+-------------------
+
+- Animated GIF loses animation if Archetypes ImageField original_size property set
+  see http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12488
+  [anthonygerrard]
+
+1.7.11 (2012-01-26)
+-------------------
+
+- Archetypes ImageField converts GIF to PNG when it scales
+  see http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/12472 [anthonygerrard]
+
+- Delete image also when field mutator is given a `None`
+  argument. Previously, an image would only be deleted if given the
+  string `"DELETE_IMAGE"`.
+
+  Note that we still return immediately if provided an empty string.
+  [malthe]
+
+1.7.10 (2011-11-24)
+-------------------
+
+- Fix DateTimeField.set() to handle all date formats DateTime handles.
+  See discussion at http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10141
+  [elro]
+
+- Add render_own_label to TypesWidget. Allows "special" widgets that need to
+  render their own label/help text for styling to override it. Closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/12355
+  [ggozad, stefan]
+
+- Add new viewletmanger that enable extra markup before the fieldsets
+  [jfroche]
+
+- Include UID of object in widget DOM ids, eg:
+  id="parent-fieldname-$fieldName-$UID". This makes it possible to
+  render multiple Archetype objects in the same view without duplicate
+  DOM ids. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/9464
+  [rochecompaan]
+
+- Fix SelectionWidgets getSelected not return selected values if the value is a int
+  with value 0
+  [martior]
+
+- Gracefully deal with ReferenceFields that had their referencesSortable flag
+  changed after creation.
+  [stefan]
+
+
+1.7.9 (2011-09-19)
+------------------
+
+- Fix: Make sure user sees login form rather than an exception when trying
+  to access /edit on an unauthorized context.
+  This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/12056
+  [davisagli]
+
+
+1.7.8 (2011-09-16)
+------------------
+
+- Raise a NotFound exception when the at_download script cannot
+  find the requested field.  I have seen the Google bot trying to
+  index at_download/info@example.org and at_download/www.example.org,
+  which is obviously wrong.
+  [maurits]
+
+
+1.7.7 (2011-08-23)
+------------------
+
+- Fixed http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11387 (Missing & orphaned labels
+  for check boxes and radio buttons) by deferring label generation for label,
+  select and multi-select widgets to each widget's edit macro. In the case
+  of the select and multi-select widgets, this allows the label to be generated
+  (or not) once the format (checkbox, dropdown...) is known.
+  Same for label for calendar widget.
+  Thanks to mattbarkau and jdeluca for researching this and proposing a solution.
+  [smcmahon]
+
+- When checking isVisible in validation, use instance, not widget as argument.
+  [tesdal]
+
+- Do a double DateTime conversion to avoid timezone naive values.
+  Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10141.
+  [rossp]
+
+- Avoid site error when we display a file whose mimetype is unknown.
+  Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/12061.
+  [thomasdesvenain]
+
+- Fixed initial content length used by textCounter. Length should be the length
+  of a unicode string, not the utf-8 string.
+  [vincentfretin]
+
+
+1.7.6 - 2011-05-21
+------------------
+
+- Fixed DisplayList slices to work on Windows 64bit. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11232.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.7.5 - 2011-05-12
+------------------
+
+- Add forward compatibility with DateTime 3.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Avoid flagging base units as changed, if their values didn't actually change.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Clarify default value of `BaseUnit.filename` to be `None` instead of
+  switching between `None` and an empty string in every request.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Rights field has text/plain format only. (If no allowable_format specified
+  for secondary fields, we get unexpected behaviour) This refs
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9345.
+  [thomasdesvenain]
+
+- Put required field indicator inside the label tag, fixes #11726
+  [dimboo]
+
+1.7.4 - 2011-04-03
+------------------
+
+- Fix bug where a TextField's default_content_type was not respected when
+  wrapping a non-BaseUnit value.
+  [davisagli]
+
+- Fixed test setup to work with ZCA-based GenericSetup profile registry.
+  [davisagli]
+
+- Fixed: all labels on edit form had 'display: block' css behaviour
+  once there was keywords.
+  [thomasdesvenain]
+
+1.7.3 - 2011-03-02
+------------------
+
+- Fixed i18n of new keywords widget.
+  [vincentfretin]
+
+- Remove method docstrings in Referenceable and ReferenceEngine to prevent
+  making them publishable.
+  [davisagli]
+
+- Fixed handling of Anonymous ownership in ExtensibleMetadata, where the
+  ownership tuple is None. Also triggered for views on FactoryTool-wrapped
+  objects.
+  [mj]
+
+1.7.2 - 2011-02-04
+------------------
+
+- Merge PLIP 11017: Tags MultiSelectionWidget w/scrollbar & checkboxes.
+  [esteele]
+
+1.7.1 - 2011-01-11
+------------------
+
+- Include plone.app.viewletmanager package to clear up plone.app.layout test
+  failures.
+  [esteele]
+
+1.7 - 2011-01-03
+----------------
+
+- Merged optimizations from the `experimental.atrefspeedup` distribution into
+  the reference engine. We avoid intersections with the large relationship
+  index and loading the persistent reference objects where possible.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Fix Referenceable, UIDCatalog to support references to non-Archetypes-based
+  content.
+  [toutpt]
+
+- Use the new `plone.uuid` package to generate UUIDs. The UID() method is now
+  an alias for ``IUUID(obj)``, which is the new preferred means of looking up
+  a UUID, since this can also work for non-Archetypes content. Archetypes
+  provides an IUUID() adapter that returns the value stored in the Archetypes
+  UID attribute. For new content, UUIDs are generated using
+  `plone.uuid.interfaces.IUUIDGenerator`, although old content will not (and
+  need not) be migrated.

+1.6.5 - 2011-02-25

+  widget when the passed value was None.
+  [maurits]
+
+1.6.2 - 2010-09-28
+------------------
+
+- Fixed error in the at_selection_widget view of a SelectionWidget if
+  the vocabulary has integer keys (usually with an IntDisplayList).
+  When a value has been filled in and the form is redisplayed
+  (e.g. due to missing required input on a different field) you would
+  loose the filled in value as it is submitted as a string, which is
+  not in the vocabulary.
+  (Fix forward ported from branch 1.5.)
+  [maurits]
+
+1.6.1 - 2010-07-18

+
+1.6b7 - 2010-04-10
+------------------
+
+- Make sure the CalendarWidget returns string representations of datetimes in
+  a format that will be treated by the DateTimeField setter as being in the
+  local timezone.
+  [davisagli]
+
+1.6b6 - 2010-04-08
+------------------
+
+- Products.Archetypes.Field.DateTimeField.set: DateTime 2.12 changed the
+  ISO-string behavior. Convert date values to a non-ISO8601 representation, so
+  that DateTime respects the server's timezone and the date's "Daylight Saving
+  Time" (DST) instead of assuming naive timezones.
+  Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10141

+  Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10140, 10141 & 10171.
+  [davisagli, witsch]
+
+- Made base_view work for public items in private folders. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9040.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Avoid str() on unicode objects before passing them to guess_content_type.
+  [deichi]
+
+- More HTML validity fixes.  The checkbox widget needs an element with
+  an id for the label to attach to.
+  [rossp]
+
+- Tolerate some cases where fieldName isn't defined yet.
+  [rossp]
+
+- The AT widget renderer has potentially very useful support for rendering a
+  widget for a field under a different name than the field name. But this
+  support has never been fully integrated into the rest of the AT widget
+  machinery. Also fixes validation errors with duplicate element ID's with
+  widget uses such as the Topic criterion edit form.
+  [rossp]
+
+- More useful description of what the description/summary is actually good for.
+  [limi]
+
+1.6b3 - 2010-02-17

+  LinguaPlone into this package.
+  [hannosch]

+- Sanitize the behavior of the 'alt' and 'title' attributes for the
+  image_field.tag function. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8756.
+  [dukebody]
+
+- Move the fields and fieldsets calculations from base_edit to the view class.
+  There's no good reason why we need to do nested list comprehensions in a
+  template.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.6b2 - 2010-01-29
+------------------
+
+- Use the http://dev.plone.org/plone/changeset/33504 "unordered" ordering

+1.6b1 - 2010-01-25
+------------------
+
+- Portal variable no longer available via global definitions - fixed in skin
+  widgets/reference.pt.
+  [thet]
+
+- Inserted explicit i18n:translate for the form tabs to make sure Chameleon
+  does the right thing. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9224
+  [limi]
+
+- Removed some test helper constants, support for Zope 2.9 has long gone.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Stop using the session_restore_value script. We never create a session in the
+  first place, so looking for one is pointless.
+  [hannosch]

+- Don't render an empty select tag when there are no keywords defined.
+  This references http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9222

+  [optilude]
+
+1.6a4 - 2009-12-27
+------------------
+
+- Cleaned up manage_options for base types. No longer show unsupported ZMI
+  screens. The functionality is still present for those that know its use and
+  limitations.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Respect the use_combined_language_codes setting from portal_languages if
+  PloneLanguageTool is installed. Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8907.

+- Let content_types.css.dtml no longer rely on content_icon.

+
+- Fixed package dependencies.

+
+1.6a3 - 2009-12-02
+------------------
+
+- Fix a regression from my adjustments to AT factories, to make sure that the
+  reference engine still gets initialized before initializeArchetype is called.
+  [davisagli]
+
+1.6a2 - 2009-11-17
+------------------
+
+- Changed the language field in ExtensibleMetadata to respect the default
+  language set on the portal_languages tool and remove incorrect "site default"
+  from the "Language neutral" term.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Updated readme and fixed reST errors in changes.txt.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.6a1 - 2009-11-17
+------------------
+
+* Remove version.txt and functions that read it.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Modified the auto-generated type factories for compatibility with CMF 2.2.
+  The _constructInstance method of CMF FTI objects now takes care of raising
+  object events for old-style factories, so AT factories no longer raise
+  their own events.
+  [davisagli]
+
+* Restructured and restyled inandout widget to fix issue with rtl scripts.
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5660
+  [emanlove]
+
+* Replaced the css_slot with the style_slot, as the deprecated
+  css_slot is now really removed in Plone 4.
+  [maurits+maartenkling]
+
+* Sanitized the log message handling. Added a simple log module based on
+  Python's logging module. The log methods in the debug module calculate
+  the entire stack frame on *every* log call.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* "Categories" are now "Tags", in line with common usage and terminology.
+  [limi]
+
+* Changed the test_metadata tests regarding dates to change reasonable times.
+  Times around the year 1000 had somewhat different timezones.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Adjust to refactoring of CMFCatalogAware and PortalFolder's use of it.
+  [davisagli]
+
+* Fix for missing short-name field due to removal of globals.
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9429
+  [esteele]
+
+* Deprecated our own IOrderedContainer interface in favor of the version
+  from OFS. We do require Zope 2.7 for a while now ;)
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Declare package dependencies and fixed deprecation warnings for use
+  of Globals.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed PloneCompat module and moved transaction_note to utils.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed tabindex and Iterator from the template scopes. Their use was
+  discouraged long ago.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed utils.getPkgInfo and `__pkginfo__`. We use setuptools as our
+  distribution and package information platform.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed unsupported AggregatedStorage. You can easily convert this into
+  an add-on package if you use this storage.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Fixed remaining test failures caused by CMFPlone dependencies. Moved
+  normalizeString method to the edit view instead of requiring plone_utils.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Created a separate layer for Archetypes, that does not depend on the
+  Five ZCML layer anymore. AT tests can finally be run in isolation of other
+  installed packages. Fixed a couple of test failures which now have a
+  deterministic output.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed a couple of assert statements which wouldn't help in any way.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Changed all references to `here` in all templates to `context`.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed reference graph visualization based on graphviz. It is
+  unmaintained and certainly not a core feature.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* ``TextField._process_input doesn't forward **kwargs`` this fix
+  https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7597 [garbas]
+
+* Traverse to ``plone_utils`` tool instead of relying on it being
+  available in global variable scope. [malthe]
+
+* Do not add empty schemas into a CompositeSchema anymore.
+  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7584.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed deprecated _guessPackage method. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7569.
+  [davisagli]
+
+* Normalizing the "id" attribute for fieldsets and fieldset legends, so
+  javascript schemata selection works for schematas that have spaces in
+  the title. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7999.
+  [rsantos]
+
+* Added a missing alt tag to the image in the file widget. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7763.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed the rebuild catalog tab from the reference and uid catalog. The
+  method is still there and can be accessed via the URL, but you won't
+  accidentally click on a tab in the ZMI anymore and have your catalog be
+  rebuilt without a warning. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8093.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Fixed the SelectionWidget view to keep the order of the passed in values
+  on output and not sort after arbitrary Python internal dict order. This
+  closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7272.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Fixed a macro expansion error when customizing templates which used
+  the folderlisting macro from base.pt. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6672.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Purged old Zope 2 Interface interfaces for Zope 2.12 compatibility.
+  Consider branching before this revision if release required before Plone 4.
+  [elro]
+
+* Avoid a failure in addCreator when called on an object without an
+  Acquisition chain.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Remove the long long deprecated 'type' class variable, which was
+  replaced with 'schema'.
+  [wichert]
+
+* Allow fields to supply their own PdataStreamIterator. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7572.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Fixed off-by-two error in transaction_note. This refs
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7610.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Add a new publish traverse that exposes image fields and their scales.
+  This removes the need for content types to have a __bobo_traverse__ method.
+  [wichert]
+
+* Move export/import step registrations to exportimport/configure.zcml. This
+  change requires CMF trunk.
+  [stefan]
+
+* Added dependencies to GenericSetup profile.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed five:implements statements from ZCML, which are already done in the
+  classes themselves.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Minor tweak in the calendar widget.
+  [deo, hannosch]
+
+* Converted Archetypes tests to use CMFTestCase as a base again, instead of
+  PloneTestCase. Fixed all tests / code to actually work without Plone
+  installed.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed Archetypes Site customization policy.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed deprecated code.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Moved rejectAnonymous script from CMFPlone over, as it is still used
+  inside base_metadata.cpt.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.5.16 - unreleased
+--------------------
+
+* Fix the ImageWidget's preview_tag method to fetch the available scale
+  sizes correctly using the field's getAvailableSizes method, rather than
+  assuming its sizes attribute is a dictionary, since callables are allowed.
+  [davisagli]
+
+* Sanitize the behaviour of the 'alt' and 'title' attributes for the
+  image_field.tag function.
+  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8756.
+  [dukebody]
+
+1.5.15 - 2010-01-25
+-------------------
+
+* Be more defensive in our assumptions about the Acquisition context of new
+  items. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10088.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.5.14 - 2010-01-14
+-------------------
+
+* FixedPointField required validation now counts zero as a value, and the
+  default default value is now None like other numeric fields, rather than
+  0.00.  This closes http://dev.plone.org/old/plone/ticket/9414.
+  [kilobug, davisagli]
+
+* Pass request when testing validation in test_fields.
+  [ccrownhart, jnelson, tesdal]
+
+* Use the same default messages than in Plone for label_effective_date and
+  help_expiration_date msgids. There is no new strings to translate.
+  See http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9633
+  [vincentfretin]
+
+1.5.12 - 2009-09-06
+-------------------
+
+* Replaced fti/title_or_id by fti/Title in edit_macros.pt.
+  This fixes content type title translation when the i18n domain is different of plone.
+  Note that the Title method defined in Products.CMFCore.TypesTool.TypeInformation
+  takes care of id fallback if the title is not defined.
+  [vincentfretin]
+
+* Fix mapping for an i18n string in Field.validate_vocabulary. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9287
+  [vincentfretin]
+
+* BaseObject.getCharset() now supports extraction of the default_charset
+  for plain CMF sites.
+  [ajung]
+
+
+1.5.11 - 2009-03-30
+-------------------
+
+* When saving an AT object only validate the visible fields in the schema.
+  (avoids hidden and invisible ones). Fixes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7964
+  [massimo]
+
+* Fix XML validity in base_edit.
+  [mborch]
+
+* Extinguishing last use of document_actions and add missing

+* check unrendered widget in KeywordWidget process_form.
+  Fix for http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8738
+  [gotcha]
+
+* Add implements-flag for ICatalogableDublinCore to ExtensibleMetadata.
+  [wichert]
+
+
+1.5.10 - 2008-09-30
+-------------------
+
+* Fire WebDAVObjectInitializedEvent/WebDAVObjectEditedEvent when
+  content is created/edited via PUT/MKCOL. This is part of the fix
+  for http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7338
+  [sidnei]
+
+* A FixedPointField with a value between -1 and 0 (e.g. 0.5) is now
+  stored as (0, -5) and shown correctly instead of as +0.5.  This
+  closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7549
+  [maurits]
+
+* Added search macro to zid.pt. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7601
+  [dukebody]
+
+* Don't bail if fieldsets is empty in 'base_edit'.  This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7858
+  [nouri]
+
+* Backported the fix for id attribute of schematas with spaces.
+  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7999.
+  [rsantos]
+
+* Backported the fix for CatalogMultiplex.reindexObjectSecurity to check
+  for the specific CMF catalog interface before trying to update the
+  security stuff. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8271.
+  [deo]
+
+* Make ExtensibleMetadata implement the IMutableDublinCore interface.
+  [wichert]
+
+* Fixed small grammar error in Field.py validation message.
+  [hannosch]
+
+
+1.5.9 - 2008-07-02
+------------------
+
+* According to rfc1806 the header is Content-Disposition not
+  Content-disposition. Case matters, at least for IE6 (and results in
+  IE6-typical strange effects).
+  [jensens]
+
+* Add a new archetypes.edit.afterfieldsets viewlet manager which
+  can be used as a replacement of the extra_bottom slot on the edit
+  view.
+  [wichert]
+
+* Add 'keepReferencesOnCopy' option to ReferenceField, which allows
+  control over whether references of that field are copied on copy
+  or not.  This defaults to False.
+  [daftdog, nouri]
+
+* Backported the fix for the KeywordWidget 'checkbox' format support.
+  [deo]
+
+1.5.8 - 2008-04-21
+------------------
+
+* Fix code in 'Field.validate_vocabulary' that would validate a set
+  of values OK if the last element was in the vocabulary, but others
+  weren't.
+  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7809
+  [nouri]
+
+* Change BooleanField to return actual booleans instead of the raw value.
+  [wichert]
+
+* Fixed validation messages to translate the inner parts of the mappings
+  explicitly. This fixes the '${label_foo} is required, please correct.'
+  messages.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Remove invalid leading whitespace in hrefs.
+  [wichert]
+
+* Fixed NameError in Field.py when an error occurs in a transform. This
+  closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7905.
+  [hannosch, sidnei]
+
+* Add a new preview_scale property to ImageWidget. This is used by the edit
+  view when showing the image. If the scale is not present the previous
+  logic (only show if the image is <100kB in size) is used.
+  [wichert]
+
+* Add a new formQuestion class to field labels.
+  [dannyb]
+
+* Don't show the 'next' button if we allow tabbing, i.e. we're
+  displaying all schematas on the same page.
+  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6936
+  [nouri]
+
+1.5.7 - 2008-03-08
+------------------
+
+* Apply patch in http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7777
+  [nouri]
+
+* Fixed calculation of default fieldset when the "default" schemata only
+  contains invisible fields.
+  [witsch]
+
+1.5.6 - 2008-02-15
+------------------
+
+* Add a plone.locking unlock subscriber for IObjectInitializedEvent. This
+  ensures non portal_factory (and LinguaPlone translations) are unlocked
+  after creation.
+  [ldr]
+
+* Show the plone.abovecontentbody viewlets once per body instead
+  of once per field.
+  [wichert]
+
+* Add checkbox in updateSchemaForm to remove the instance schemas.
+  This is possibly needed when going from Archetypes 1.5.1 or
+  earlier to a newer version.  Should be safe unless you know that
+  you have content items with local schemata that you need to keep.
+  [maurits]
+
+* In mkDummyInContext use _setObject instead of setattr.  This means
+  dummy content in the tests shows up when using
+  context.objectIds().
+  [maurits]
+
+* Remove test dependency on ArchetypesTestUpdateSchema as this does
+  not work on Zope > 2.7.  Unused tests removed.
+  [maurits]
+
+* Changed 'form.inlineForm' in 'archetypes_kss/at.kss' to use
+  'kssSubmitForm' instead of simply 'currentForm'. This is needed
+  to support multi-valued form variables in inline editing.
+  This is dependent on http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/changeset/9200
+  [raphael]
+
+* Calling `getDefault` twice is unnecessarily slow and could potentially
+  cause bugs when a `default_method` returning an object is used for the
+  field.  In that case the field would get initialized with one instance,
+  but a second, different instance would be returned from the call to `get`.
+  [witsch]
+
+1.5.5 - 2007-12-29
+------------------
+
+* If allow_discussion is set as an attribute on a content type class,
+  ExtensibleMetaData.allowDiscussion() may hit a bug in CMF 2.1.0's
+  CMFDefault.DiscussionTool.overrideDiscussionFor() that tries to delete
+  a missing attribute, causing an AttributeError. This may be avoided by
+  using GS instead of a class attribute to control discussion on the
+  type, but there's no reason I can see to break old code. Fixed by
+  catching exception. Closes http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/761
+  [smcmahon]
+
+* Archetypes should inform the widgets when processing the form in the
+  validation phase.
+  This closes http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/760
+  [deo]
+
+* Backported the fixes from r8665 and r8804: zope.i18n.translate calls
+  should use the request, not the instance itself as the context.
+  [deo]
+
+1.5.4 - 2007-11-07
+------------------
+
+* Made the getSelection method in browser/widgets.py return the selection
+  in the character set of the vocabulary -- not the input value.
+  Fixes issue #759, UnicodeDecodeError with selection/multiselection
+  widgets.
+  [smcmahon]
+
+* CalendarWidget would not return a value without JavaScript support from
+  calendar_formfield.js. This is disabled for unauthenticated users in
+  Plone 3. Added a process_form override method to CalendarWidget to
+  assemble the input components.
+  [smcmahon]
+
+* Revert http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/changeset/8683 - Dont skip the
+  'metadata' schema in base_edit. Wichert and I agreed thats this is
+  wrong. Specially inside a bug-fix release. If theres a good reason to
+  remove the metadata from fieldsets, we can do it in the next release.
+  The UI was broken as well, btw.
+  [jensens, wiggy]
+
+1.5.3 - 2007-10-07
+------------------
+
+* Skip the 'metadata' schema in base_edit, like we used to do it
+  pre-1.5.  Also, do not render fieldset and legend elements when
+  we're only displaying one fieldset, i.e. the 'default' one.
+  [nouri]
+
+* Provide bbb alias for ReferenceEngine.UIDCatalog. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6507.
+  [hannosch, naro]
+
+* Restore use of the defaultLanguage method for the language field and
+  undeprecate it. This is done for two reasons: there is no alternative
+  to this feature, which LinguaPlone requires, and there never was a
+  deprecation warning.
+  [wichert]
+
+* Fix clicking on the "next" or "previous" button raises
+  'Non-existing fieldset: None'.
+  http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/754
+  [encolpe]
+
+* Forward-ported the disable-delete-option-when-required feature of image
+  widgets from 1.4.
+  [mj]
+
+* Re-added UIDCatalog import to ReferenceEngine for sites migrating from
+  Plone 2.1 (where the UIDCatalog is a class in that module).
+  [mj]
+
+1.5.2 - 2007-09-12
+------------------
+
+* Changed browser/configure.zcml to update unnecessarily restrictive
+  permissions for two widget views. These were requiring ModifyPortalContent
+  even though they exposed no private information, thus making the widgets
+  less useful outside Archetypes.
+  [smcmahon]
+
+* Made OrderedContainer implement OFS.interfaces.IOrderedContainer.  Fixes
+  bug #7084 in Plone issue tracker.
+  [rocky]
+
+* Update schema handling code to always use self.Schema() to get the current
+  schema and never (re)set self.schema.
+  [wichert]
+
+* Fix the change made in 1.5.1 which produced invalid XHTML
+  [limi]
+
+1.5.1 - 2007-09-10
+------------------
+
+* Updating the AT widget views to be rendered inline, so they can be
+  invoked in View mode by KSS without any special magic. This is a
+  prerequisite for bug #6705 in the Plone issue tracker.
+  [limi]
+
+1.5.0 - 2007-08-16
+------------------
+
+* ImageField.set used 'size' attribute instead of 'get_size' API.
+
+* added support for default DCMI "Right" using the portal_metadata
+  tool. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5831.
+  Remark: overall support of portal_metadata is very poor.
+  [jensens]
+
+* Removed hard dependency on the plone.locking package.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed a hard dependency on the plone.i18n package in Field.py.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Don't attempt to convert to 'text/plain' in
+  Archetypes.Field.FileField.getIndexable if there's no path to it.
+  This avoids loading the whole file contents into memory for these
+  cases.
+  [nouri, drjnut]
+
+1.5.0-rc3 - 2007-07-27
+----------------------
+
+* Fixed the msgid for the description of the location field. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6797.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.5.0-rc2 - 2007-07-13
+----------------------
+
+* Added a special fieldproperty type for reference fields, with a more
+  generic base class for any field accessors/mutators that need to acquire
+  tools. This uses a workaround for the fact that not all tools are
+  utilities (yet) and acquisition doesn't work properly in property
+  descriptors.
+  [optilude]
+
+* Fixed allowDiscussion handling in ExtensibleMetadata.
+  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5977.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.5.0-rc1 - 2007-07-04
+----------------------
+
+* Removed all utility registrations.
+  [hannosch, wichert]
+
+* Fix incorrect test for value added to a display list. This fixes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6634
+  [wichert]
+
+* Corrected wrong i18n markup in edit_macros. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6583.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Updated keywords related i18n messages to reflect their new name.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.5.0-b5 - 2007-05-05
+---------------------
+
+* Never validate fields that are not writeable.
+  [optilude]
+
+* Remove colors from log entries.
+  [wichert]
+
+1.5.0-b4 - 2007-04-28
+---------------------
+
+* Added an ATDateTimeFieldProperty version of the ATFieldProperty mentioned
+  below. This takes care of conversion between Zope 2 DateTime's and Python
+  datetime objects.
+  [optilude]
+
+* Convert filename to ASCII in Content-Disposition header on
+  download. This fixes #620.
+  [nouri]
+
+* Added Products.Archetypes.fieldproperty.ATFieldProperty, which can be
+  used analogously to zope.schema.fieldproperty.FieldProperty for Archetypes
+  fields. See the doctest in that module for details.
+  [optilude]
+
+* Added an at_textarea_widget view and used it instead of the checkSelected,
+  unicodeEncode and lookupMime scripts on the textarea and visual widgets.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Replaced the getSelectionWidgetSelected script introduced in beta2 with the
+  at_selection_widget browser view. This allows us to use a Python generator
+  and safes us from iterating over all values in the vocabulary, when the
+  first value is already the selected one.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Make the boolean widget work correctly with or without javascript.
+  [elvix]
+
+* Removed the default value for starting_year from the CalendarWidget. This
+  ensures the value can be looked up dynamically from the properties.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Disable the content border when an object is being added using
+  portal_factory. These tabs don't make sense in an "add form" scenario,
+  and were causing errors.
+  [optilude]
+
+1.5.0-b3 - 2007-03-20
+---------------------
+
+* Refactored installation code. This is now based on a GenericSetup extension
+  profile instead of the old Extensions/Install.py way.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed tests/runalltests.py and tests/framework.py as they have
+  outlived their usefulness. To run tests use Zope's testrunner:
+  ./bin/zopectl test --nowarn -s Products.Archetypes
+  [stefan]
+
+* Added the Location element (also known as Coverage in Dublin Core) to the
+  standard metadata set. This allows lots of interesting things like
+  geotagging of images, location notices on news items, etc.
+  [limi]
+
+1.5.0-b2 - 2007-03-05
+---------------------
+
+* Added a new LanguageWidget that does the same as the SelectionWidget but
+  does not try to translate the vocabulary using the normal translation
+  machinery. It should use the Zope 3 locales information instead.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Speed up the selection widget considerably by calculating the selected
+  values ones and not for every value in the selection using a new
+  getSelectionWidgetSelected script.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Modernized some code in checkSelected and unicodeEncode scripts.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed explicit invocations of the translate script from various
+  vocabulary widgets. The getValue method of a vocabulary returns a Message
+  which can be translated by the usual TAL engine.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Allow field defaults to be looked up using an adapter of the instance
+  to IFieldDefaultProvider, with a name that is the same as the field name
+  in question (only if no default or default_method was set for that
+  field). This allows dynamically determined, context-sensitive defaults
+  without having to add a method into the class itself.
+  [optilude]
+
+* Make it possible to use vocabulary_factory for fields, giving the name
+  of a Zope 3 style named IVocabularyFactory utility. This means that
+  Archetypes fields can use more general Zope 3 vocabularies, and share them
+  with e.g. formlib forms.
+  [optilude]
+
+1.5.0-b1 - 2007-02-27
+---------------------
+
+* Fixed deprecation warnings for minimalpath in skins install code.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Updated error message handling in validation to use Zope3-style translation,
+  which is available in the latest PTS.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* FileField is now a bit cleverer about indexing.  If you set a file
+  field to be 'searchable' it will now per default attempt to
+  convert it to plain text on indexing.
+  [nouri]
+
+* Replaced status message handling with new approach based on
+  Products.statusmessages. This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6131.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Automatic title to id generation is now optionally based on the plone.i18n
+  package instead of requiring the plone_tool.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Merged the plip174-reusable-i18n branch. This adds the optional ability to
+  control the language metadata on objects by an utility approach based on
+  plone.i18n.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.5.0-a2 - 2007-02-06
+---------------------
+
+* Removed the typeDescription and typeDescMsgId attributes from all content
+  classes. These were only used on the edit form which has been altered to
+  use the Description method from the type information instead.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed some BBB code in generator/i18n.py.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Adjusted some code to work better with the CMF 2.1 tools as utilities work.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Fix failing test in traversal.txt:184, where an acquired template
+  overrode a view.  Added logic to BaseObject.__bobo_traverse__ to
+  make sure the right order is respected.
+  [nouri]
+
+* Turned off debug mode for writeable checks on fields per default, as this
+  caused a major performance problem with KSS.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Made it work with the kss merge in. Some templates are modified,
+  extra markup is added and a kss decorator view is defined that is
+  overwritten if kss is loaded. Currently the addability support in
+  the reference and inandout widgets has its javasacript commented
+  out, this needs to get fixed asap.
+  [ree]
+
+* By default base_edit will show all fields of all schemas on one page now.
+  The old behaviour can be kept by marking a content type with the
+  IMultiPageSchema interface.
+  [fschulze]
+
+* Made ATSiteTestCase inherit its layer from PloneTestCase.
+  [stefan]
+
+* Fixed a DeprecationWarning for listContentTypes(by_metatype=1).
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.5.0-a1 - 2006-10-25
+---------------------
+
+* Cleaned up event usage: IObjectCreatedEvent is now fired during generated
+  constructor, and two custom events are fired during processForm() -
+  IObjectInitializedEvent and IObjectEditedEvent. Both inherit from
+  IObjectModifiedEvent, and the Initialized event is fired on the first
+  save, whereas the Edited event is fired on subsequent saves.
+  [optilude]
+
+* Applied patch from George Lee and modernised code a bit for Zope 2.10,
+  to support event-based pre- and post-validation. See interfaces/_event.py
+  [optilude]
+
+* Cleaned up VarClassGen a bit to make it potentially useful for people
+  needing it as part of a custom ISchema adapter.
+  [optilude]
+
+* Made it possible to look up AT schema using an adapter from self
+  to ISchema. See note in Schema/factory.py.
+  [whit, optilude]
+
+* Fix #585 by providing the right arguments for testCondition in templates.
+  [nouri]
+
+* Added small optimizations for DisplayLists to not translate values of type
+  Message by itself, added some tests.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Deprecated explicit msgid attributes on DisplayLists. Store Zope3 Messages
+  directly as values instead to get the same behavior.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Deprecated the generator.i18n module. We use the translate method of the
+  GlobalTranslationService directly for now, as long as we support
+  PlacelessTranslationService. Ultimately this should be replaced by calls
+  to 'from zope.i18n import translate'
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed outdated message catalogs and changed the few remaining texts in the
+  'archetypes' domain to use the 'plone' domain instead. The translation
+  files can be found as usual as part of the PloneTranslations product.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Changed BaseObject and ExtensibleMetadata to use new Message approach for
+  internationalization of labels and descriptions.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Optimized the basic widget for the new default case of labels and
+  descriptions as Messages. These are not translated automatically anymore
+  but this is delayed to be triggered by the time they are rendered in a TAL
+  context. This will ultimately safe quite some translation machinery hackery.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Modernized DisplayLists to use isinstance instead of type checking. Now
+  derived string types like Messages are allowed as keys and values as well.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed last bits of dependency version checks from __init__.py as well as
+  support for INSTALL_DEMO_TYPES. These types are not meant to be used in a
+  live site but only serve as code examples and are used during test runs.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Renamed sample_content profile to sample_types as it only includes types
+  but no content ;) This profile is not registered globally anymore but only
+  during test runs, as these types aren't meant to be used for anything else.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Marked Base* as implementing their Z3 interfaces.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Based tests on PloneTestCase with extension profile support for site setup.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Added (Default) alias to base_view to all sample types, so calling them will
+  still work in CMF >= 2.0.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed deprecated spec argument from listFolderContents and
+  folderlistingFolderContents of BaseFolderMixin.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Changed import of TAL.ndiff to zope.tal.ndiff.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Cleaned up XXX comments, converted non-critical ones to TODO.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed five:traversable from configure.zcml as it is not needed anymore for
+  Zope 2.10, which we require now.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Cleaned up some comments, removed a pdb and an unused zLOG import.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed some more BBB code.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed deprecated ArchetypesTestCase.py.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Adjusted rest tests to Zope2.10 output.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Remove BBB code for calendar_macros.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.4.5 unreleased
+----------------
+
+* Encode values in Field.toString so we do not fall over fields with
+  unicode default values that contain non-ASCII text.
+  [wichert]
+
+* Fixed possible Unicode problem in BaseObject's SearchableText. This
+  closes http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/720.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.4.3 - 2011-05-21
+------------------
+
+* Add an ObjectModifiedEvent right after `initializeArchetype`,
+  since that modifies the object with default values defined in the
+  schema.
+  [nouri]
+
+* Fix http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/712: Do not put security
+  declarations on a ComputedAttribute, or on 'def content_type(self)'.
+  [mj]
+
+* BooleanWidget always displays 'True' and 'False'. This is very IT-centric!
+  In real world people prefer 'Yes' and 'No' - or custom settings. Latter was
+  fixed before, but Archetypes should have a sane default behaviour, so its
+  now changed to display 'Yes' and 'No' - and is l10n aware.
+  [jensens]
+
+* BooleanWidget offers to show something different than True/ False in view
+  macro using a vocabulary. Unfortunally it passed a boolean to the
+  DisplayList, which raised a TypeError. Now we pass the string
+  representations 'True' and 'False using 'str(key)', so one can define
+  a vocabulary like [('True', 'Yes'), ('False', 'No')].
+  [jensens]
+
+* Fix http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/686: "zid.pt does not
+  respect the portal wide visible_ids setting".
+  [nouri]
+
+* The last change expected portal_type global available. This is true for all
+  good archetypes products ;-) but failed with CacheSetup, where editmacros
+  was called w/o setting it. Archetypes now ignores this missing global and
+  inititalize it to 'unknowntype'.
+  [jensens]
+
+* for better css styling hpeter added a class and a id to edit_macros form
+  element, which enables per-type styling of base_edit.
+  [jensens]
+
+* Fix unicodeEncode skin method to deal with sequences; fixes SelectionWidget
+  with underlying LinesField case where the current value was not reflected
+  in the edit widget. Fixes issue #705.
+  [mj]
+
+* BaseContent.PUT will now also fire the object modified event.
+  [nouri]
+
+* Update the base folder types to use sane permissions for
+  manage_copyObjects, manage_pasteObjects, manage_renameObject(s)
+  rather than the default 'View management screens' given by
+  OFS.CopySupport (the permission mapping used is from
+  Plone.PloneFolder)
+  [alecm]
+
+* Backported the catalog unindexing silencer code from trunk, as in contrast
+  to the former code on this branch it doesn't use any private attributes.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Fixed translation domain of two messages in go_back.cpy. These were missing
+  from the Archetypes translation files.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.4.2-final - 2006-12-15
+------------------------
+
+* Fixed missing declaration of timestamp property in TextAreaWidget for
+  append_only mode.
+  It may need a better intregration of plone datetime format property.
+  [encolpe]
+
+* Fixed missing i18n statement for the text format label on visual widgets.
+  This closes http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/687.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Fixed a minor issue of FixedPointField: It now works with integer default
+  value.
+  [jensens]
+
+* Add a try: finally: clause in AllowedTypesByIfaceMixin when deleting
+  the typeinfo "temporarily" Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5314
+  [alecm]
+
+* Fix the unique name finder during initial rename on create so that it
+  checks the names validity.  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5044
+  [alecm]
+
+* Fix BaseObject.isBinary to not assume AttributeStorage.  Fixes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5822
+  [alecm]
+
+* Silenced more catalog unindexing log error messages by checking if
+  an object exists in the catalog before uncataloging.
+  [rocky]
+
+* Fixed #5963. Now all the first headers of the page have
+  "documentFirstHeading" class applied.
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5963
+  [spliter]
+
+* Fixed #5929. UID catalog rebuild broke path convention.
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5929.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Made tests use layers for AT site setup.
+  [stefan]
+
+1.4.1-final - 2006-09-08
+------------------------
+
+* Fix #635.  Large files were truncated on `setFileName`.  In
+  `setFilename` of FileField, we now set the `filename` attribute
+  directly instead of retrieving the BaseObject, setting the
+  filename and setting the object again.
+  [nouri]
+
+* Fixed log_exc function in debug.py to print the actual exception including
+  the traceback.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* base_edit (anything calling processForm, actually) now fires off
+  appropriate IObjectCreatedEvent and IObjectModifiedEvent zope 3 events
+  [rocky]
+
+* Made the BaseObject __bobo_traverse__ fallback on Five traversal except in
+  those cases where it would return something different.  This allows views
+  to override acquired attributes. (this change is not intended for Zope 2.10,
+  which behaves differently)
+  [alecm]
+
+* Fixed simple xhtml non-compliance and some erroneous i18n markup.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Make all WebDAV request types return NullResources on failure, not just PUT
+  and MKCOL.  This fixes a test failure resulting from some Zope traversal
+  machinery tweaks.  Thanks to sidnei for webdav guidance.
+  [alecm]
+
+* Safari uses HTTP_ACCEPT=='*/*', which meant that the image widget never
+  rendered an image due to some faulty boolean logic.
+  [alecm]
+
+* Backport of fix for #585 from trunk
+  [nouri]
+
+* Add a multiple catalog aware reindexObjectSecurity to BaseObject. This
+  fixes problems with security checks in catalogs when objects are changed
+  through other means than normal editing (such as workflow changes).
+  [wichert]
+
+* Fix #670: addCreator function fails with AttributeError in
+  ExtensibleMetadata.  This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/670
+  [nouri]
+
+1.4.0-final - 2006-06-16
+------------------------
+
+* Undeprecated 'public', there are too many products relying on it and it's
+  just a name change without any real benefit.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.4.0-RC1 - 2006-06-02
+----------------------
+
+* Use zope.contenttype in favor of zope.app.content_types if available.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Added a new GenericSetup profile 'sample_content' which installs all
+  available sample content types. This should mainly be used as a basis for
+  the test setup.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.4.0-beta1 - 2006-05-12
+------------------------
+
+* Added support for <catalog> entries to be added to the GenericSetup
+  profile description of portal types to enable registration w/ multiple
+  catalogs in the archetype_tool.
+  [rafrombrc]
+
+* Fixed a problem in Field.py which could split mutibyte characters at a wrong
+  position, which could cause encoding problem in mimetypes_registry.
+  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5214.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Add GenericSetup support for importing/exporting the catalog map from
+  ArchetypeTool
+  [wichert]
+
+* Use portal type instead of meta type for the catalog map. Add an option
+  to config.py to switch back to the old behaviour.
+  [wichert]
+
+* Removed some old commented out code.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Added a archetypes historyaware mixin, providing access to archetypes
+  persistent revisions (including annotations).
+  [mj]
+
+* Moved 'index_method' computation out from Extensions/utils.py into
+  Field.  Because we want SearchableText of BaseObject to use the
+  'index_method' too.  This fixes
+  http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/645
+  [nouri]
+
+* Avoid DeprecationWarnings for manageAddDelete methods and converted the
+  logging infrastructure to use Python's logging module in favor of zLOG.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Removed reST-test-kludge. reStructuredText of Zope < 2.8 is buggy,
+  don't bother with test failures.
+  [stefan]
+
+* converted remaining interfaces and unconverted metadata due to
+  issues with CMF1.5's bridges
+  [whit]
+
+* converted add following modules to zope3 interfaces w/
+  backward bridges::
+  interfaces/_annotations.py

+  assist in bridging
+  [whit]
+
+* removed superfluous bridge statements from zcml
+
+* Spring-cleaning of tests infrastructure.

+1.4.0-alpha03 - 2006-03-26
+--------------------------
+
+* Fixed some bizarro bug where the __call__ method of BaseFolder (i.e.
+  render the default view) was instantiating a new CMFCore PortalFolderBase
+  object and returning it (unrendered even).
+  [alecm]
+
+* fixes #617: Do not catch KeyboardInterrupt.
+  [jensens]
+
+* marked PhotoField as deprecated. After work done on ATImage and
+  ImageField this one isnt needed anymore in Archetypes core.
+  PhotoField and its supporting classes will be removed in AT 1.5
+  [jensens]
+
+* fixed #600: Auto-generated attributes are not protected by
+  permissions. Attention: Enabling protection is a minor change in
+  the config.py. Some products with code doing direct attribute
+  access will break. People using and relying on those products
+  can disable attribute protection, but better fix those Products.
+  [jensens]
+
+* fixed #608: Protect id field by 'Copy or Move'
+  [jensens]
+
+* fixed #637: Schema.moveField( ... after ) does incorrect reordering.
+  Needed fixing of a buggy doctest.
+  [jensens]
+
+* merged in code of Daniel Nouri to support multiple references
+  with the same name between two objects, thsi is needed for example
+  with Relations product. Thx Daniel.
+  [jensens]
+
+* removed superfluos code from ClassGen.
+  [jensens]
+
+* Removed some nonsense on PUT that would look at REQUEST._steps and
+  try to catch a exception (which would never occur!). Made it use
+  'PATH_INFO' instead, with a fallback to 'self.getId()' which
+  should suffice (PATH_INFO is always available as long as the
+  request came in through ZPublisher.Publish).
+  [sidnei]
+
+* PdataStreamIterator could potentially end up loading a persistent
+  object after the ZODB connection had been closed. Made it use a
+  temporary file to stream out the content so that large files don't
+  end up using all the available memory.
+  [sidnei]
+
+1.4.0-alpha02 - 2006-02-23
+--------------------------
+
+* Added check for duplicate 'accessor', 'edit_accessor' and
+  'mutator' method names on a schema's fields. Helps Joe Schmoe to
+  get unstuck, hopefully.
+  [sidnei]
+
+* dont generate 'Schema' method any more. its now part of BaseObject.
+  [jensens]
+
+* seperated UIDCatalog from ReferenceEngine.
+  [jensens]
+
+1.4.0-alpha01 - 2006-01-26
+--------------------------
+
+* Remove BBB code for CMFBTreeFolder import location.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Make import from ``Products.Archetypes.atapi import *`` default and deprecate
+  public.
+  [jensens]
+
+* Integrated 'generator' into Archetypes.
+  [jensens]
+
+* Changed transactions use to new API and removed some Plone 2.0 backwards
+  compatibility code
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Changed imports of CMFCore.CMFCorePermissions to CMFCore.permissions
+  [k_vertigo, hannosch]
+
+* DisplayLists should be a little less strict on their values. Now not only
+  unicode itself but also types inherited from unicode are allowed. This is
+  needed to handle zope.i18nmessageid.MessageID objects correctly.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.3.10-final2 - 2006-09-14
+--------------------------
+
+* Check mimetype before schema update and reapply type after. This fixes
+  http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/618
+  [alecm]
+
+* Fixed import of NotFound in getBestIcon.py which broke CMF1.4 compatibility.
+  This closes http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/656.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.3.9-final - 2006-05-16
+------------------------
+
+* Add a new generateNewId method to BaseObject which is used to suggest
+  a new id when automatically renaming an object after creation. This makes
+  it easier to used custom naming in derived types.
+  [wichert]
+
+* Fix visual widget to not lose formatting if there's only one allowed
+  content type - without passing this variable along, the field will revert
+  to text/plain or MIME type guessing the second time it's saved.
+  [optilude]
+
+1.3.8-final - 2006-04-30
+------------------------
+
+* Cleanup of CatalogMultiplex: removed superfluos code, added docstring
+  and comments.
+  [jensens]
+
+* Moved 'index_method' computation out from Extensions/utils.py into
+  Field.  Because we want SearchableText of BaseObject to use the
+  'index_method' too.  This fixes
+  http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/645
+  [nouri]
+
+* Removed reST-test-kludge. reStructuredText of Zope < 2.8 is buggy,
+  don't bother with test failures.
+  [stefan]
+
+* Fixed WebDAV MOVE breaking references and cleaned up flagging of
+  reference copying for good measure.
+  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/642
+  [sidnei]
+
+* Fixed up some templates that were abusing tabindexes to get unique ids on
+  form elements. Tabindexes can no longer be used for this reliably
+  since Plone 2.1.3, and repeat/var/number is cleaner anyway.
+  [optilude]
+
+* fixed http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5072
+  [jensens]
+
+* fixed #637: Schema.moveField( ... after ) does incorrect reordering.
+  Needed fixing of a buggy doctest.
+  [jensens]
+
+* Removed some nonsense on PUT that would look at REQUEST._steps and
+  try to catch a exception (which would never occur!). Made it use
+  'PATH_INFO' instead, with a fallback to 'self.getId()' which
+  should suffice (PATH_INFO is always available as long as the
+  request came in through ZPublisher.Publish).
+  [sidnei]
+
+* PdataStreamIterator could potentially end up loading a persistent
+  object after the ZODB connection had been closed. Made it use a
+  temporary file to stream out the content so that large files don't
+  end up using all the available memory.
+  [sidnei]
+
+* Changed sidneis last 'fix'. Dont raise an exception. This is changed
+  behaviour and I cant accept this in a bugfix release. Prints out
+  a deprecation message instead now, to not break Products relying on
+  the old - odd - behaviour.
+  [jensens]
+
+* Added check for duplicate 'accessor', 'edit_accessor' and
+  'mutator' method names on a schema's fields. Helps Joe Schmoe to
+  get unstuck, hopefully.
+  [sidnei]
+
+* Backported fix for failing Windows mime types:
+  Original fix: http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/changeset/6005
+  Bug details here: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5109
+  [limi]
+
+* Cleanup of CatalogMultiplex: removed superfluos code, added docstring
+  and comments.
+  [jensens]
+
+* Fixed missing import of PersistentMapping.
+  Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5182
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Usability fix for file widget ( widgets/file.pt ) so that the
+  radiobuttons with 'Keep existing file' and similar are no longer shown
+  if there is no file uploaded.
+
+* fixed bug in getBestIcon.py, use NotFound class but not 'NotFound'
+  string in exception.
+  [panjunyong]
+
+* fixed bug in AllowedTypesByIface, prevented to copy, paste, rename
+  objects using the mixin.
+  [jensens]
+
+* fixed problems introduced by last 'fix' of IdWidget zid.pt: Member
+  and widget settings was ignored :-(
+  [jensens]
+
+1.3.7-final - 2006-01-16
+------------------------
+
+* fixed problems with IDWidget ignore_visible_ids in some setups.
+  [sidnei, rafrombrc]
+
+1.3.6-final - 2006-01-07
+------------------------
+
+* enable IDWidget to ignore global visible_ids setting and enable ids by
+  adding a property ignore_visible_ids=False (default). If it is True
+  the id (short name) is shown and the global or by-member setting is
+  ignored. This is useful for types where control over the id is needed.
+  [jensens]
+
+* 'Renderer' is used to set locals to context of rendered widgets. added
+  prefix support for fieldnames in widgets to enable archetypes for multi-
+  object edit forms.
+  [jensens]
+
+* debug.ClassLog -> generateFrames calls pythons 'inspect' function. This
+  breaks on at least one OS-X Tiger system with an IndexError (normal setup).
+  Now IndexError is catched and ignored.
+  [jensens]
+
+* cleanup of install_indexes magic to add index and metadata-columns to
+  a catalog. also added an alternative method than 'schema()' to use, for
+  example if a CatalogTool itself is archetypes based. The alternative i
+  method is 'zcschema' and does not conflict with Archetypes schema
+  attribute.
+  [jensens]
+
+* Moved the byline to the header to be consistent with Plone 2.1.
+  [limi]
+
+1.3.6-RC1 - 2005-12-29
+----------------------
+
+* Make rename-after-creation resolve duplicates by appending -n, where n is
+  a number, to the id when an existing object exists in the parent folder.
+  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4510.
+
+* Return the new PdataStreamIterator when a Pdata-like chain is
+  found (we always assume this if the marshaller didn't return a
+  string). This way it works better with ExternalEditor.
+  [dreamcatcher]
+
+* PrimaryFieldMarshaller was overriding already computed 'length'
+  with len(data). Yuck.
+  [dreamcatcher]
+
+* Fixed http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4768 - wrong status message.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Fixed typo in BaseBTreeFolder.__init__. Thanks jenner.
+  [stefan]
+
+* Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4840. Resync some texts with Plone.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4981. BaseObject.__bobo_traverse__ now
+  also handles HEAD requests.
+  [stefan]
+
+* Made basically compatible with Zope 2.9 by using a wrapper around the
+  transaction module.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Lower the bar for making folderish content implement WebDAV/FTP
+  'PUT' and 'GET' by adding a new flag ``__dav_marshall__``  that
+  just needs to be flipped to 'True' for folderish content.
+  [dreamcatcher]
+
+* Finally changing the last toPortalTime call to toLocalizedTime
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Permission for setting creation date and modification date: Portal
+  Manager should it be allowed to set it manually!
+  [yenzenz]
+
+1.3.5-final - 2005-10-11
+------------------------
+
+* Fixed http://members.plone.org/collector/4709 __bobo_traverse__ calls
+  will not be passing a RESPONSE argument.
+  [alecm]
+
+* Fixed filename detection for temporary files on Windows.
+  [dreamcatcher]
+
+* Fixed [ 1289596 ]. Field.ImageField.tag did not escape alt and title
+  attributes.
+  [elro] [stefan]
+
+* Repaired ClassGen as to not stomp over declarePublic and
+  declarePrivate security declarations. Patch by Jens Vagelpohl.
+  [dreamcatcher]
+
+* Fixed some places where a session was being created nedlessly. Now
+  sessions will only be created when they are really used. I hope
+  this is the last occurrence.
+  [dreamcatcher]
+
+* Fixed at_post_create_script hook to only be called once (was previously
+  called after every edit) and added an at_post_edit_script hook to be
+  called on every subsequent edit (but not the first create/edit).
+  [elro]
+
+1.3.4-final - 2005-08-30
+------------------------
+
+* added tests if the test engine i working fine, this shows the effect
+  of http://plone.org/collector/4487 verbose.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* applied patch to BaseObject.unmarkCreationFlag() with unwanted
+  acquisition of at_post_create_script. thx Aparajita Fishman
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* enabled renaming of fields while copy them. it eases field recycling.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* fixed [ 1265581 ] Deleting a file withn optional FileField/FielWidget
+  breaks
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Fixed a number of issues related to the oversimplicity of
+  CatalogMultiplex.manage_after*.  Workflow state was not being reset on
+  object copy, which is a minor security issue.  Discussions were not being
+  removed from the catalog when the parent was deleted.  Copied discussions
+  were not being added to the catalog.  The owner local role was not being
+  set on copy.  CMFUid objects were not being removed on copy (critical for
+  CMFEditions).  CatalogMultiplex now delegates manage_after* methods to
+  CMFCatalogAware (except manage_afterClone which it overrides to do a full
+  reindex before delegating).  Removed calls in BaseFolder to
+  PortalFolder manage_after*, as those are just inherited directly from
+  CMFCatalogAware whose methods are now used in CatalogMultiplex.
+  [alecm]
+
+* Fixed an issue where copying a BaseBTreeFolder resulted in references on
+  subobjects of that folder being duplicated due to bad inheritance of
+  _getCopy.
+  [alecm]
+
+* download of files from FileField: filenames where cutted at
+  first space character in filename. report, fix/patch by
+  LaurenceRowe, thx!
+  [yenzenz]
+
+1.3.4-rc3 - 2005-08-07
+----------------------
+
+* import of CMFBTreeFolder changed with CMF 1.5.3, kept it backward
+  compatible. thx to TresEquis.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* FileField: On download provide a filename. Patch form Tim Hicks
+  applied. Needs optional UI to change filename, atm it uses the
+  name of the uploaded file. thx tim2p.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* theres no application/octet.  http://www.iana.org/assignments/
+  thanks to lalo for this pick.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+1.3.4-rc2 - 2005-08-01
+----------------------
+
+* Skip image scales with a size of (0,0)
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed handling of boolean usage in allowDiscussion for the CMF 1.5
+  DiscussionTool.
+  [alecm]
+
+* Fixed two Marshaller bugs. PrimaryFieldMarshaller wasn't using the mutator
+  for a field and RFC822 marshaller was trying to add field, image and
+  object fields to the header. Fields of these types contain binary data
+  or instances of OFS.Image.Image and can't be marshalled as header.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1209047 ] edit method broken on BaseBTreeFolder. Also added some
+  im_func fu to BaseBTreeFolder.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1236601 ] bug in method getAvailableSizes()
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed critical bug in RFC822 Marshaller w/ CMF 1.5 The
+  CMFDefault.utils.parseHeadersBody function capitalizes the header names
+  and breaks demarshalling. Marshall contains a light weight
+  reimplementation.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added ftests for id autogeneration.
+  [alecm]
+
+1.3.4-rc1 - 2005-07-17
+----------------------
+
+* Fixed http-etag test. It now 1) refreshs etag on reindexObject and 2) also
+  must update etag on metadata modification (like Title).
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Fixed bug when get full BaseUnit object from FileField
+  [panjunyong]
+
+* Fixed file edit widget to disable upload by default when javascript enabled
+  [panjunyong]
+
+* Fixed at_download to return values from field.download
+  [panjunyong]
+
+* Tiny change to image.pt widget template to render a link directly
+  to the image object
+  [rafrombrc]
+
+* Added Five/Zope3 interface bridges
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fix http://plone.org/collector/4268 Type descriptions were not
+  translated and fixed the usage of archetype_name in templates.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Prefer isIDAutogenerated from plone_tool over the script if available.
+  [alecm]
+
+* some minor i18n tweaks
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Added options for PIL quality and resize algo to ImageField.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed #1212048: ReferenceField "set" broken for
+  BaseBTreeFolder-based objs.
+  [dpunktnpunkt]
+
+* Fixed #1230645: unnecessary call to str() method in SQLMethod.
+  [dpunktnpunkt]
+
+1.3.4-beta2 - 2005-07-06
+------------------------
+
+* Fixed outstanding errors with ImageField. ImageField is now using
+  the same api and processing methods as FileField. Empty images are
+  neither created nor returned by the accessor/mutator.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added a wrapper for indexing object in the uid catalog to fix unicode
+  issues.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added AllowedTypesByIface, a mix-in that allows you to restrict
+  allowed_content_types by interface.  We want a better way to do
+  this for 1.4.  ArchGenXML support is under way.
+  [dpunktnpunkt]
+
+* Reworked ArchetypeTool.listPortalTypesWithInterfaces.  Note that
+  the former version only returned AT types as well.
+  [dpunktnpunkt]
+
+* Moved mark creation flag code from ATContentTypes 1.0 to AT. This is the
+  right place for the code. It requires Plone 2.1 but doesn't barf if no or
+  and older version is installed.
+  [tiran, alecm]
+
+* As a part of the mark creation flag code the _renameAfterCreation()
+  method is added. It can be turned on by setting _at_rename_after_creation
+  to True. Thx to Alec Mitchell for his code!
+  [tiran, alecm]
+
+* Fixed issue with ImageField where an empty string was passed down to
+  PIL resulting in an exception.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Updated the type registration code to be compatible with CMF 1.5 and to
+  support method aliases and CMFDynamicViewFTI.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Made utils.filterTypes compatible with CMF 1.5
+  [tiran]
+
+* generalised the interface detetection for types and listings of it
+  in archetypes_tool and adapted TemplateMixin lists and detection to
+  use this code.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* calendar_slot has been renamed to calendar_macros in Plone
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Fixed failed test in ISchema: removed 'self' in interface method.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Expose field creators of ExtensibleMetadata.
+  [yenzenz, optilude, alecm]
+
+* Make it easy to rename fields and keep its content. Introduced a property
+  old_field_name. Patch from Kai Hoppert. Thx!
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Merged madduck-refactor-content-edit-1_3 branch r4283:4363 into
+  release-1_3-branch:
+  content_edit.cpy cannot be called directly by other .cpy scripts,
+  because FormController seems to bestow control upon content_edit.cpy on
+  invocation. This patch moves the code (unchaned) to content_edit_impl.py
+  and replaces content_edit.cpy with a simple call to this .py. As
+  a result, SQLWindowStorage can use AT's content_edit and needs no code
+  duplication, and AT continues to work as before.
+  For reference, please see:
+  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.zope.plone.archetypes.devel/4959
+  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.zope.plone.user/35620
+  [madduck]
+
+* Merged madduck-renderingfixes-1_3 branch r3956:4361 into
+  release-1_3-branch:
+  Reworked base_{view,edit} wrt CSS and Javascript. previously, CSS and
+  Javascript were both rendered into the javascript_head_slot and there
+  was no way to influence it really, other than on a per-field basis with
+  helper_css and helper_js. No way to do it per-type though. My patch
+  splits CSS into the css_slot and makes both templates look in the user
+  templates for optional CSS/Javascript macros ('css' and 'javascript')
+  much in the same way that the header/typedescription/body/footer parts
+  are acquired. For base_edit, this is trivial since edit_macros is
+  defined inside the css and javascript macros provided by the user (they
+  are evaluated in the context of base_edit itself, which defines
+  edit_macros). For base_view, this is not possible. Thus there is code
+  duplication, which I documented in the form of comments in the
+  templates.
+  Added a condition to the errors span for each field in widgets/field.pt
+  such that in the absence of an error, no HTML is generated. This avoids
+  some rendering problems when multiple widgets are to be rendered on the
+  same HTML line.
+  [madduck]
+
+* Introduced manage_afterPUT and manage_afterMKCOL hooks that are called
+  after a webdav or ftp PUT/MKCOL operation.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed MKCOL of BaseBTreeFolder to call the right MKCOL method from
+  BaseFolder resp. SkinnedFolder.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Moved document_actions above title on base.pt.
+  [deo]
+
+1.3.4-beta1 - 2005-05-20
+------------------------
+
+* Fixed [ 1192453 ] Typo in Extensions/utils.py on line 117. Thanks
+  to salmacis.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Solved unicode encoding problem on set of textfield.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Unquoted filename when uploaded from ftp/webdav.
+  [panjunyong]
+
+* Fixed [ 1184475 ] Template Mixin UI still borked.
+  Attention: All types are bound to portal_type know. If you're using
+  a type where meta_type!=portal_type you have to rebind your templates
+  to the type! This should affect not too many people.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Fix issue [ 1174598 ] default action title overrides custom title if
+  set using 'name' instead of 'title'.
+  [alecm]
+
+* Made the show_hm flag for CalendarWidget work.
+  [alecm]
+
+* Added hidden macro to boolean widget fixes issue [ 1144139 ].
+  [alecm]
+
+1.3.3-final - 2005-04-22
+------------------------
+
+* Changed default for Language metadata field to empty string (''). Also
+  removed the undesired fallback magic.
+  [stefan]
+
+* Fixed [ 1187630 ] AT rebuilds reference catalog by default on product
+  install.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+1.3.3-rc3 - 2005-04-21
+----------------------
+
+* Added optional 'visible_only' argument to Schemata.editableFields();
+  modified base_edit to use 'visible_only=True' so the edit form will
+  not display schemata that contain no visibly editable fields.  Default
+  behaviour for editableFields should remain the same.
+  [rafrombrc]
+
+* Applied two performance optimizations:
+  BaseObject.getCharset() no longer calls the PythonScript of same name.
+  This method is called bazillions of times and using a script here is
+  enormously wasteful. The script has been kept as fallback.
+  ExtensibleMetadata.listCreators() now calls getOwnerTuple() instead
+  of getOwner() to avoid lookup of user folder and user.
+  [stefan]
+
+1.3.3-rc2 - 2005-04-01
+----------------------
+
+* Fixed plone bug #3959 (http://plone.org/collector/3959), made
+  OrderedContainer.moveObjectsByDelta not throw an error when passed the id
+  of a non-contentish object.
+  [alecm]
+
+* Fixed [ 1061971 ] maintain order in InAndOut and PickLists across edits.
+  [alecm]
+
+* Fixed hidden variant of MultiSelectionWidget.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Changed warnings.warn(...) to deprecated(..) from Archetypes.debug.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Fixed [ 1171059 ] Archetypes should not set language explicitly on content.
+  Default is set to None by default. For backward compatibility reasons, I
+  added a switch in config to enable old behaviour.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Added subject to SearchableText.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added ComputedAttributes for effective_date and expiration_date.
+  [tiran]
+
+1.3.3-rc1 - 2005-03-25
+----------------------
+
+* Fixed [ 1163878 ] Field.toString() always return the same thing. Thanks
+  to flacoste for the patch.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Fixed [ 1153525 ] zid.pt hidden mode hardcode field name. Thanks to
+  flacoste for the patch.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Fixed Referencefield making it possible to completely avoid ugly paths in
+  the selectionlist (set vocabulary_display_path_bound=-1 to never get the
+  paths).
+  [elvix]
+
+* Fixed problem with encoding enforcement on TextField. Now has same behavior
+  as StringField, but is neutral to old behaviour. If you call 'get' on a
+  TextField and give a kwarg 'encoding' it has been ignored, now its used.
+  It returns the encoding requested.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Fixed [ 1160362 ] AT 1.3.2-final bug on PrimaryFieldMarshaller by adding the
+  missing import of shasattr in Marshall.
+  [tiran]
+
+* textarea.pt and image.pt were broken under 2.7.2 (newline in python
+  expression).
+  [gotcha]
+
+* Correct getMsgId on DisplayList (when using int keys) and IntDisplayList
+  Fixes [ 1159248 ] IntDisplayList.getValue triggers DeprecationWarning.
+  [gotcha]
+
+* Made ComputedFiled inherits from Field instead of ObjectField (which
+  should only be used with fields that handle storages).

+
+1.3.2-final - 2005-03-05
+------------------------
+
+* Made deprecation warnings less verbose. If someone wants them, switch
+  DEBUG in config.py to True.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Added IntDisplayList to the public module.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added Sidney's AttributeValidator to BaseObject. It's disabled for now
+  because it might break third party software which relies on a broken
+  behavior. You can enable it by setting ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY to True.
+  [tiran]
+
+1.3.2-rc1 - 2005-02-26
+----------------------
+
+* Using registerType without a package name is deprecated. Explict is better
+  than implicit!
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed DisplayList for int keys. The warning module was missing *blush*
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added IntDisplayList to utils.py. Also I've coded some nice doc tests for
+  DisplayList and IntDisplayList.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed[ 1118780 ] Bad validation for required IntegerFields with value zero
+  Also the default values for IntegerField and FloatField are None instead of
+  0.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Applied patch from [ 1076738 ] PrimaryFieldMarshaller: wrong length.
+  [dmaurer]
+
+* Changed the reference tab permission to modify or review according to
+  [ 1087990 ] 'References' action visible for everyone.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed customizationpolicy.py not to break if CMFPlone isn't available.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Updated the requirements to Zope 2.7.4+. It may work with older versions of
+  Zope 2.7.4 but due some serious memory leaks and some important bug fixes
+  you should really use Zope 2.7.4!
+  [tiran]
+
+* Backported CMFTestCase/PloneTestCase based test suite from AT 1.4 branch to
+  AT 1.3. The unit test suite of AT 1.3 was horrible. Yeah you are allowed to
+  beat me up but in excuse I must say it was first try in using ZopeTestCase.
+  I've learned my lessons. In order to run the unit tests you have to install
+  either CMF 1.4.7 + CMFTestCase + ZopeTestCase or Plone 2.0.5 + PloneTestCase
+  + ZopeTestCase. For now only the CVS versions from sf.net collective are
+  working properly.
+  To run the unit tests go into the root of your testing instance and run:
+  ZOPE_HOME/bin/test.py -v -C etc/zope.conf --libdir Products/Archetypes/
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1103955 ] ObjectManager raises (usually) AttributeError.
+  [dmaurer]
+
+* Fixed [ 1074236 ] DDocument and Fact are broken in 1.3.1 final.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1093042 ] log warning for int keys in DisplayList.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1067212 ] missing security declaration for
+  BaseFolder.manage_addFolder.
+  [biza]
+
+* Fixed [ 1114892 ] should set to field, not fieldname in
+  ObjectField.getRaw().
+  [madduck]
+
+* More OrderedDict fixes... wasn't overriding 'pop' method from base class,
+  causing keys list and data to get out of sync if it were ever called.
+  [rafrombrc]
+
+* Fixed broken implementation of moveObjectsByDelta in ordered base folder
+  by copying my code from CMFPlone. I've fixed it in Plone over an year ago
+  but I forgot to fix it in AT.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1114362 ] use format name instaed that mime type inside RichWidget.
+  [dan_t]
+
+* Filtering schemata from showing up on base_edit unless user actually
+  has edit privs to some of the fields.
+  [rafrombrc]
+
+* Fixed utils.OrderedDict problems:
+  - constructor was failing w/ non-empty argument
+  - infinite loop when copy() was called
+  [rafrombrc]
+
+* Changed UI for Image/File widgets. Should be a lot better now.
+  [_ender_]
+
+* BaseUnit backward compability on very old bad migrated Archetypes 1.0
+  sites. Thanks to Brent M Hendricks <brentmh@rice.edu>.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Commented out the View/Edit links for ordinary display - feel free to
+  enable these in your site, but they should definitely not be there by
+  default.
+  [limi]
+
+* Added the last (and only) info that isn't being handled by AT for FTI:
+  allow_discussion. Now you can define it at class level, as any other
+  FTI property. The module level modify_fti method still exists for any
+  advanced configuration.
+  [deo]
+
+* Improved test for [ 1003868 ] to demonstrate the real problem:
+  default_charset isn't respected. Now when db_encoding isn't defined,
+  we give precedence to site_encoding and then fallback to utf-8.
+  Bonus: there's no more need to mess with 'sys.getdefaultencoding()'
+  to make tests run... ;-)
+  [deo]
+
+* The subobject Wrapper class is now based on Acquisition.Explicit. And
+  BaseObject's subobject works now.
+  [panjunyong]
+
+* Applied ApeSupport changes needed for APE 1.0. Thanks to Roch?ompaan.
+  Changed comment to doc-string.
+  [yenzenz, zwork]
+
+* Added Italian translation. Thanks to Mirto Silvio Busico.
+  [deo]
+
+* Change permission of OrderedBaseFolder's manage_renameObject to make
+  FTP works.
+  [panjunyong]
+
+* Fixedi [ 1053960 ] Cancel goes back to previous schemata page, thanks
+  to Alec Mitchell.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Fix redirect of ZMI constructor, fix ZMI base_add and base_edit.
+  [__gotcha]
+
+* Fixed [ 1058669 ] Wrong i18n:translate in widgets/field.pt.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Use method getFilename in at_download.pt instead of direct attribute access,
+  which ignores BaseUnit.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Fixed [ 1084278 ] In www/generateDebug.zpt error in *
+  getTypeInfo(type['name']).
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Applied patch in [ 1076864 ] schemata links need css declaration, thanks to
+  David Convent.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Fixed [ 1067923 ] Field.py: ImageField.get_size does not work properly.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Fixed bugs in the reference graph feature that was broken for me.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Fixed [ 1066884 ] Field.py: getAvailableSizes 1.3.1-rc4. Thanks to Steve
+  McMahon.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Fixed path to kernel uuid pseudo file.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Don't use the format selector from wysiwyg.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed __pkginfo__.py: use version.txt instead of coping a string to
+  several places; changed license to the current license "BSD-like".
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Fixed reference cataloging when dealing with BTree folders.
+  [brcwhit]
+
+* Fixed [ 948385 ] Allow wysiwyg editors to override RichWidget format
+  pulldown.
+  [duncanb, ender]
+
+* Fixed traversal/WebDAV for the nth time, now with tests.
+  [dreamcatcher]
+
+* Fixed a possible problem when installing uid_catalog.
+  [zopezen]
+
+* Added multi-field support to getFilename/setFilename and also
+  getContentType/setContentType. Bonus: reformated ChangeLog... ;-)
+  [deo]
+
+* Updated Catalan translation. Thanks to Albert Lombarte.
+  [deo]
+
+1.3.1-final - 2004-11-15
+------------------------
+
+* Some visual fixes to RichWidget and Field code + removed stray comments.
+  [limi]
+
+* Fixed field tests.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+1.3.1-rc4 - 2004-11-06
+----------------------
+
+* reverted the patch from duncan because of too many bugs :(
+  final decicion for 1.3.x: we keep the 1.3.0-final reference copy
+  behaviour.
+  [hazmat, geoffd, yenzenz]
+
+* fixed reference_slot, wasnt adapted to the new style reference engine.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+1.3.1-rc3 - 2004-11-05
+----------------------
+
+* There where lots of discussions about the behaviour of references while
+  copying. it ends up in 1.3.0-final with the default behaviour to do not
+  copy references if a object is copied. now this is for several use-cases
+  a great problem, and it's also difficult to copy them afterwards.
+  finally we decided to make it configureable per reference in 1.4.x. A
+  solution for 1.3 is provided by the patch from duncan booth we applied
+  here. its transparent to the 1.3.0-final behaviour. you now can set
+  in archetypes tool the copying behaviour. it defaults to not copy
+  references.
+  [duncanb, yenzenz]
+
+* Changed boolean widget so that the checkbox is displayed before
+  the label and not below the help text. Makes more sense UI wise.
+  [_ender_]
+
+* Fix manage_delObjects of BaseFolderMixin that did not return anything.
+  [__gotcha]
+
+* Allow comma as dezimal delimiter in FixedPointField and convert it
+  immediatly to a point-delimited-value. The whole process needs a rewrite
+  in 1.4, this here is only a quick non-immersive usability enhancement.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+1.3.1-rc1 - 2004-10-17
+----------------------
+
+* Fixed [ 1037265 ] Bug in ArchetypeTool:getWidgets(). Thanks to Tommy from
+  IBAS for the catch.
+  [deo]
+
+* Fixed a bug with TemplateMixin on folderish types: in navtree and on view
+  tab the choosen template has been ignored, cause it felt back to an action
+  folderlisting, which now is set to view instead.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Applied patch contributed in [ 1038107 ] Problems with addable_types
+  handling in ReferenceWidget. Thanks to Alec Mitchell for the patch.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+* Added Archetypes Site customization policy.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Changed it so that Title is not shown twice in view mode (once in the headline
+  is fine, thank you ;)
+  [limi]
+
+* Fixed [ 1042076 ] missing import in SQLMethod.py: atoi and time were missing.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1043114 ] WEBDAV folder creation broken.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Updated quickref. Thanks to Jean Jordaan for his great work!
+  [neaj, tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1037803 ] "AT Document Details" should be "Document Details" in edit
+  Now Archetypes is using the portal type name by default instead of the
+  archetype_name. You can change the new behavior by using a different
+  type_name var in the templates.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added some ugly hacks to ship around [ 1040623 ] FTP upload broken. You may
+  say it's fixed for AT 1.3 but for AT 1.4 we will have a much better
+  implementation.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1038404 ] BaseFolder.mange_delObjects proteced by wrong permission.
+  Now the method is protected by CMFCorePermissions.DeleteObjects instead of
+  CMFCorePermissions.ModifyPortalContent which is exactly like Plone 2.x.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1038428 ] Unicode string in Subjects break base_metadata page.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Partly fixed [ 1038450 ] Unauthorized due to BaseObject.__bobo_traverse__.
+  Now __bobo_traverse__ is raising an AttributeError instead of returning None
+  when the object can't be traversed.
+  [dmauerer, tiran]
+
+* Added workaround for [ 1040514 ] AttributeError on some types after migration
+  1.2.4rc5->1.3.0 to BaseUnit. Somehow and sometimes the binary attribute gets
+  lost magically.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Extensions/utils.py (install_additional_templates): Added a method to
+  automagically register classes that inherit from TemplateMixin.
+  [deo]
+
+* Added Catalan translation file. Thanks to Albert Lombarte.
+  [deo]
+
+* Added viewableFields() and editableFields() to Schema. The methods are
+  returning only those fields that the current user is allowed to see/edit in
+  the current context.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Archetypes edit form is raising unauthorized if no editable fields are
+  available.
+  [tiran]
+
+* BaseContent.PUT and BaseUnit.PUT is also trying to get the uploaded data from
+  BODY if BODYFILE is empty.
+  [tiran]
+
+1.3.0 - 2004-09-30
+------------------
+
+* Fixed [ 1034649 ] Typo breaks catalog index creation: index_acessor ->
+  index_accessori.
+  [ronnix]
+
+1.3.0-rc4 - 2004-09-25
+----------------------
+
+* Fixed [ 1032587 ] Error in field.Vocabulary. Thanks to Danny Bloemendaal
+  for the catch.
+  [deo]
+
+* Disabled two unit tests in test_marshaller because they were causing a memory
+  fault in glibc. It's probably the cause of either wvWare or the test doc
+  file.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added transaction_note to PloneCompat and use it instead of the one from
+  Plone to keep backward comp. with CMF as requested on the mailing list.
+  [tiran]
+
+1.3.0-rc3 - 2004-09-18
+----------------------
+
+* Fixed misc unit tests that where broken or relied on a broken behavior.
+  [dreamcatcher]
+
+* Merged patch from [ 1026732 ] base_metadata can not use 'add $type' reference
+  button.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1029648 ] getBestIcon needs to be better.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Partly fixed [ 1024966 ] Reference migration problem: 1.3a2 --> 1.3rc2.
+  References without a relationship name will get the relationship name
+  EMPTY_RELATIONSHIP which is 'related' by default. That should be fine for all
+  people.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added 'swallowResizeExceptions' attribute to ImageField. When the property is
+  set to True all exceptions raised by PIL are captured and the specified scale
+  isn't created.
+  Note: Some scales might be created when PIL fails only for some sizes.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Field.ReferenceField: Simplify code a bit. Fix a typo on exception name.
+  [dreamcatcher]
+
+* Fixed [ 1023153 ] isEmpty validator must return empty string by using the new
+  isEmptyNoError validator.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1029231 ] base_metadata doesn't use JS scripts properly, also cleaned
+  up the base_metadata and added support for helper CSS.
+  [tiran, kai]
+
+* Fixed [ 1025842 ] Missing i18n:translate in widgets/field.pt <label>
+  [tiran]
+
+* Cleaned up and fixed ExtensibleMetadata class:
+  no more direct attribute access or attribute storage, rearranged some lines,
+  use 'date is None and fallback or date' because testing for is None is,
+  much faster than testing a DateTime instance for not None.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added SQL* and VariableSchemaSupport to public.py. Please import only from
+  public!
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added class and id attributes to fields rendered in view-mode (field.pt).
+  These had been accidentally left out.
+  [elvix]
+
+* Fixed problem with BaseBTreeFolder losing references. It was calling
+  CMFBTreeFolder manage_* methods which would end calling
+  PortalFolder.manage_* methods (as they are not overriden in the class
+  hierarchy) twice. The second type it would remove the references as
+  there's a monkeypatch on Archetypes/patches.py which sets _v_cp_refs to
+  None when calling CMFCatalogAware.manage_beforeDelete.
+  [dreamcatcher]
+
+* Fixed copy problem with AggregatedStorage by added __getstate__ and
+  __setstate__ methods. Before the chances copy.deepcopy was trying
+  to copy a thread lock.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Finally removed markCreationFlag which was a bad hack to achieve the same
+  effect as portal_factory but w/o using portal_factory. I had a problem with
+  it again and I don't want to have more headache!
+  [tiran]
+
+* Changed BaseObject.initializeArchetype() to call edit() instead of update().
+  edit() is an alias for update and it's also the standard method to edit a
+  type in CMF. It makes customization like in ATContentTypes much easier.
+  [tiran]
+
+1.3.0-rc2 - 2004-09-04
+----------------------
+
+* Removed class="error" from field.pt error message. It caused some ui
+  glitches.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1011658 ] portal_skins/archetypes folder disappeared after AT
+  reinstall. Under some circumstances the skins aren't properly registered.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1011533 ] AT CEILING date for expires will break DateIndex. Changed
+  CEILING_DATE from year 9999 to year 2500.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1012238 ] Cannot set field using boolean widget under IE.
+  [duncanb]
+
+* Changed TemplateMixin.getDefaultLayout(): It first checks for an attribute
+  'default_view' then for 'immediate_view' from the FTI and at last it's using
+  'base_view' as fallback.
+  [runyan, tiran]
+
+* Removed warning when trying to apply an index on a reference field from
+  install_indexes. Indexes on reference fields are fully supported again.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Changed permission of BaseObject.getField() and getWrappedField() from
+  ModifyPortalContent to View. All mutators on fields are secured and it won't
+  make any harm to get a field. Besides it is currently possible getting a
+  field over archetype_tool.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1012344 ] 'NoneType' not callable error on CMFMember prefs page. Also
+  cleaned up the way how the value is calculated inside field.pt. Depending
+  on widget.populate it's either assigning edit_accessor or accessor to a var
+  and THEN it's calling the var (which is a method) when it's not None.
+  Sounds complex? Well the former version was much complexer.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Subclasses TemplateMixin from ExtensionClass.Base, set default_view to None
+  in order to enable the immediate_view magic and made the getDefaultView()
+  method a little bit more efficient.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added a test for unqualified references to Schema to prevent user errors. A
+  relationship must be a non empty string. Also moved all field tests in Schema
+  to a new method _validateOnAdd().
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added Danish translation. Thanks to stonor!
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added 'de-de' as fallback to the German translation.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Applied fix from [ 924832 ] Widget:isVisible always returns 'visible' for not
+  DictType which is fixing a broken behavior for Widget.isVisible().
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1012570 ] Widget.py ReferenceField is horribly inefficient.
+  [runyan]
+
+* Temporary fix for [ 1012408 ] __getitem__ doesn't play nice which is backward
+  compatible except of three broken behaviors:
+  BaseObject.__getitem__ now throws an Unauthorized exception when trying to
+  get an item starting with _ and it throws a KeyError when trying to access
+  a nonexisting object. Also it's using explicit acquisition.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed unicodeTestIn.py: return False immediately when the list is None or empty.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Widget.py: Changed some field.get(instance) calls to
+  field.getEditAccessor(instance)() to get rid of some sort of infinite loop
+  (in append_only code forTextAreaWidget).
+  [rafrombrc]
+
+* Readded Extensions/utils.py:install_tools for backward compat.
+  [dreamcatcher]
+
+* fixed edit view rendering of append_only textarea history in
+  widgets/textarea.pt data so whitespace is correct.
+  [rafrombrc]
+
+* Fix a misbehavior on __bobo_traverse__ now that Tiran changed the __getitem__
+  behavior. Before that, __getitem__ was taking precedence and acquiring the
+  object itself, so never getting this far:
+  Nothing has been found. Though it's not written anywere, from deep ZPublisher
+  inspection it seems like we *SHOULD NOT* raise a notFoundError, but instead,
+  return None and leave acquisition do it's job.
+  [dreamcatcher]
+
+* Fixed [ 1011111 ] mishandling of UID W.R.T layers.
+  The reference engine is now using _getCopy() mark the copy of an object with
+  a marker _v_is_cp so manage_afterAdd() can detect copies in order to reassign
+  a new UUID and remove the reference annotations.
+  [bcsaller, rochael]
+
+* Fixed Alan's fix for [ 1012570 ] brains has no relative_url.
+  (note to myself: addable option on ReferenceField still needs lots of tests)
+  [deo]
+
+* Fixed [ 1013265 ] last changes to Widget.py is highly inefficient.
+  [deo]
+
+* Fixed LinesWidget according to [ 1013379 ] LinesField/widget broken.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed bug in VariableSchemaSupport.VarClassGen mentioned in the thread on the
+  AT devel mailing list. See "Warning: avoid changing your AT class' meta_type
+  when you have existing instances".
+  [mitchel, dreamcatcher, tiran]
+
+* Corrected icon in ZMI; Added some utils for ZMI setup.
+  [__gotcha]
+
+* Changed unit test to work with an unpatched version of getToolByName to get
+  mimetyptes_registry and portal_transform.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1015956 ] getBestIcon can fail.
+  [ctheuni]
+
+* Fixed [ 1015292 ] boolean widget error, [ 1015394 ] 1.3 branch field.pt sets
+  value = None inappropriately and another problem with field.pt value.
+  [tiran, alecacct]
+
+* Fixed [ 1018821 ] _processInput in Field.py should rewind.
+  [batlogg]
+
+* Part fix [ 1013363 ] (renaming of folders nukes all references to AT
+  objects inside them):
+  It works now for AT folders, but renaming of non-AT folders stil breaks refs
+  to their contained items so ATContentTypes based portals should be fine now
+  (except you rename the portal itself).
+  [zworkb]
+
+* Added monkey patch for CMFCatalogAware, PortalContent and PortalFolder to
+  fix the second part of [ 1013363 ].
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1019803 ] Bug in ArchetypeTool.py: getWidgets(), also renamed
+  _is_fake_instance to _at_is_fake_instance.
+  [johtha, tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1018300 ] schema defined indexes are not set anymore.
+  [deo]
+
+* Added targetId index to reference_catalog. It was removed earlier to make
+  the ref catalog more lightweight. However, it broke
+  ReferenceCatalog._queryFor.
+  [dpunktnpunkt]
+
+* Explictly reinstall MimetypesRegistry, PortalTransforms and Archetypes when
+  running the migration. Before MTR and PT weren't reinstalled ever and AT
+  under some circumstances which were leading to annoying bug reports.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added StdoutStringIO to migration.py which is printing the input to stdout,
+  too. Also added some gimmicks to the migration: After 10 items a '.' is
+  printed to stdout and after 250 items a '*' is printed to stdout so you can
+  see how the migration is coming along.
+  [tiran]
+
+1.3.0-rc1 - 2004-08-16
+----------------------
+
+* Try to use BaseUnit for schema migration to keep the mimetype and the
+  filename of a BaseUnit based field. Without the changes the mimetype of
+  TextField got lost.
+  This should fix [ 1001446 ] Content type lost in migration from pre 1.3b4 to
+  1.3b4
+  [tiran]
+
+* Changed portal type of ComplexType to keep it compatible with AT 1.2
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed typo in Field.Field.getContentType
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed Field.ImageField.rescaleOriginal to always return a binary string. This
+  fixes the problem with original_size: [ 1004323 ] "IOError: cannot identify
+  image file" when uploading image
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1004510 ] folderlisting or plone_utils.browserDefault by adding an action
+  'folderlisting' to folderish content types.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Use True and False in favor to 1 and 0 to make the code more readable.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Raise an error when trying to use an index on a reference field unless we
+  have a good solution to avoid catalog corruption.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Use edit accessor instead of the accessor in Schema.BasicSchema.validate().
+  [alecacct]
+
+* Added a index_method property to Field.Field which may be either _at_accessor,
+  _at_edit_accessor or the name of a method which is used as accessor for the
+  index.
+  [alecacct]
+
+* Starting from NOW all attributes starting with '_at_' are reserved for
+  internal usage. You MUST NEITHER add NOR access any attributes starting
+  with '_at_' in your content types.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed  FTP/WebDAV's PUT in BaseObject:If a new object should be created with
+  an id that can be acquired, then the existing object is silently overwritten
+  rather than a new one created
+  [dm]
+
+* Fixed with problem MKCOL/MKD used by FTP/WebDAV and
+  BaseFolde.manage_addFolder. Now MKCOL/MKD are creating a sub folder with the
+  type name of the current folder except when this behavior is overwritten
+  by an attribute called _at_type_subfolder.
+  [dm]
+
+* Fixed [ 1006559 ] addReference allows adding garbage references. addReference
+  is raising a ReferenceException when an invalid source or target was applied.
+  [duncanb, tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1006491 ] File widget makes useless str(value) conversion
+  [tiran, lurker]
+
+* Fixed possible issue inside ArchetypeTool.getWidgets() by calling
+  initializeArchetype() on the wrapped dummy instance.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Update catalog on reference catalog has raised a KeyError when trying to
+  access an object that was already removed. Now ReferenceResolver is fetching
+  the KeyError in resolve_url() and returns None instead.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added getRaw() method to LinesField which is returning the output of get().
+  Before this change the edit accessor was using the accessor which might be an
+  overwritten accessor. Thanks to Joel Burton who has figured out the problem.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Raise an ReferenceException inside Field.ReferenceField._Vocabulary when the
+  brain doesn't have a valid uid.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Refresh the uid catalog and reference catalog after migration.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Don't commit full transactions inside migration. This may lead to database
+  corruption.
+  [tiran]
+
+* General cleanup of imports and public.py. Also include Marshallers in public.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1007850 ] Cancel content creation fails with portal factory tool
+  Archetypes is playing nice again with portal factory
+  [tiran]
+
+* Raise SchemaException when trying to add two or more primary fields to one
+  content type. Adding more than one primary field can lead to unexpected
+  behaviors.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Don't store mimetype item instances in BaseUnit. Now BaseUnit is storing the
+  mimetype and the binary flag as ordinary strings. Old BaseUnits are auto-
+  magically altered using __setstate__().
+  Storing mimetype item objects in BaseUnit seemed to lead to memory leaks.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Reenabled ints as DisplayList and Vocabulary keys.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Subclass InAndOutWidget from ReferenceWidget which adds the addable feature
+  to InAndOutWidget.
+  [ender]
+
+* Removed old and deprecated old_OrderedBaseFolder implementation from
+  Archetypes.
+  [tiran]
+
+* There is no need to subclass BaseFolder from Folder since SkinnedFolder is
+  already subclasses from Folder (over PortalFolder).
+  [tiran]
+
+* Store subobjects inside a volatile attribute instead of using SESSION which
+  1) was broken by design 2) was a possible memory eater.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 988948 ] Reference field: radio button "no reference" isn't checked
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added properties for [ 1008670 ] Feature request: specify year interval for
+  the Calendar Widget
+  Right now these properties are useless because the plone templates can't
+  handle it but I got word from limi that we are allowed to add these features
+  to the templates
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1005843 ] Stringfields should not default to '0' in search mode
+  [tiran]

+* ImageField: Fixed problem with empty image field and calls to getScale,
+  getSize and tag()
+  [tiran]
+
+* Cleaned up the Extensions/utils.py function which are installing AT and it's
+  dependencies. Added a method setupArchetypes() which is setting up the internals.
+  These fixes are fixing the problem that AT don't seemed to be installed when
+  it's installed from an AT based product.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Schema: fixed a bug, it wasnt allowed to override a primary field by another
+  primary field with the same name.
+  [jensens]
+
+* Added getWrappedField(key) to BaseObject which is returning the field
+  instance explictly wrapped relative to the Archetype instance. This method is
+  required for security reasons in order to allow Zope to find the acl_users.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1009894 ] CSS class on validation error messages. It's using Plone's
+  'error' class.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed two bugs in ttw template registration. 1st the registration-tab was
+  broken, and 2cd it can't deal with migrated ATCT.
+  [jensens]
+
+1.30beta5 - 2004-08-06
+----------------------
+
+* Fixed forbidden access to schema methods when the schema was
+  acccessed using archetype_tool.lookupType().
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed typo in widgets/reference.pt
+  [tiran]
+
+* Do not depend on plone's document_byline template which is
+  not available in CMF.
+  [ajung, tiran]
+
+* Applied patch from [ 997044 ] db_encoding parameter is lost
+  in BaseSQLStorage.set
+  [biza, tiran]
+
+* Updated complex type to make it work inside Plone again. It's very
+  usefull to test fields and widgets.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Applied [ 974846 ] Patch for bug #944343 inandout/picklist values
+  not sticky to make picklist and inandout compatible with reference
+  field again.
+  [alecacct, tiran]
+
+* Reenabled Ben's reference graph tool by removing some stalled testing code
+  [tiran]
+
+* Support unqualified references in reference graph tool
+  [bcsaller]
+
+* Added a test for mimetypes registry before adapter call in BaseUnit.update()
+  with a more verbose error in the case the user hasn't updated MTR properly.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed Find Objects of uid catalog and reference catalog: Use the relative
+  path (relative to the portal) of the object as uid instead of the full
+  physical path
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added Rebuild Catalog tab to uid catalog and reference catalog to make the
+  life easier
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added context to the PortalTransform.convertTo() call in BaseUnit.transform()
+  [tiran]
+
+* Don't fail to install a product which doesn't have any types
+  [spamsch]
+
+* Catch Unauthorized exception in ExtensibleMetadata.allowDiscussion that could
+  be raised by the discussion tool when the authenticated users hasn't
+  ModifyPortalContent permissions.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added IUIDCatalog and IReferenceCatalog interface. Test for interfaces in
+  the installation process of Archetypes to remove invalid catalogs.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added a check to Field._Vocabulary: A result from portal catalog must be a
+  result from uid catalog, too.
+  [ender]
+
+* FileField/ImageField: Make sure we always get a wrapped object in content_class
+  [tiran]
+
+* ImageField: Fixed getScale/getSize methods, added tag() method
+  [tiran]
+
+* session_save_form was using direct attr access in UT
+  code you must use Schema accessor so schema has a
+  security context
+  REMEMBER: <BradB> "Free as in Free Iraq"
+  [runyaga]
+
+* issue a warning if they register 2 classes with the
+  same name in the same project.  this will happen on
+  startup.
+  [runyaga]
+
+* do not assume templates have title_or_id attribute
+  [runyaga]
+
+* Added kernel_make_uuid which is using /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuids as source
+  for unique ids. Thanks to Ben for this cool idea. :)
+  The kernel uuid generator is actually a tiny bit slower than our uuid
+  generator but it should be safer if you are worried about the uniqueness of
+  uuids.
+  [bcsaller, tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 1002481 ] Missing i18n: <any>, added at_search_any msgid.
+  [tiran]

+------------------------
+
+* Fix bug on image deletion [clebeaupin]
+
+* Fixed [ 997899 ] 1.3b3 will ot startup on Zope 2.7, Windows.
+  Removed api helper to avoid problem with windows [dreamcatcher, tiran]
+
+* Small improvements on migration (using aq_base() instead of attribute, using
+  is None test instead of simple bool test)
+  [tiran]
+
+* Get the first non None object instead of the first element of a list of
+  brains to circumvent problems with stalled objects inside the uid catalog
+  [tiran]
+
+* Don't raise AttributeError when no reference can be found
+  [__gotcha]
+
+* Fixed a problem introduced by getRaw method on ReferenceField class.
+  When using a field on 'hidden' mode, field.pt uses field.edit_acessor
+  to get field value (and edit_accessor calls getRaw).
+  The problem was related to ReferenceFields not multivalued where
+  getRaw always returns a list, instead of the single UID.
+  [deo]
+
+* Added a flag refresh_references to Archetypes.Extensions.utils.installTypes
+  (default False). When enabled it's using ZopeFindAndApply to find all
+  objects of the given types and refreshes their references. This is a
+  workaround but not a real fix for bug 997840.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added a test for at_version information
+  [tiran]
+
+* Support Pdata (possible large data from OFS.Image) as type for FileField.
+  This is required to load large images and files based on OFS.Image into a
+  FileField.
+  [tiran]
+
+* Merged sid's security branch. DefaultLayer based classes (Field, Widget) and
+  schema are now subclassed from ExtensionsClass.Base.
+  [dreamcatcher, tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 994511 ] Field.py: Vocabulary cannot handle 2-tuple list
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed creation_date field to be metadata again
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 944440 ] getMsgID method of DisplayList should be used
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 972091 ] base widget doesn't support visble attribute for view
+  [tiran]
+
+* Added better traceback information to fixAfterRenameType
+  [tiran]
+
+* Fixed [ 988898 ] Don't swallow ConflictError (SQL missing)

-1.7.7 (2011-08-23)
-------------------
-
-- Fixed http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11387 (Missing & orphaned labels
-  for check boxes and radio buttons) by deferring label generation for label,
-  select and multi-select widgets to each widget's edit macro. In the case
-  of the select and multi-select widgets, this allows the label to be generated
-  (or not) once the format (checkbox, dropdown...) is known.
-  Same for label for calendar widget.
-  Thanks to mattbarkau and jdeluca for researching this and proposing a solution.

-  Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/12061.

-  [vincentfretin]
-
-
-1.7.6 - 2011-05-21

-
-- Avoid flagging base units as changed, if their values didn't actually change.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Clarify default value of `BaseUnit.filename` to be `None` instead of
-  switching between `None` and an empty string in every request.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Rights field has text/plain format only. (If no allowable_format specified
-  for secondary fields, we get unexpected behaviour) This refs

-  [esteele]
-
-1.7 - 2011-01-03
-----------------
-
-- Merged optimizations from the `experimental.atrefspeedup` distribution into
-  the reference engine. We avoid intersections with the large relationship
-  index and loading the persistent reference objects where possible.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Fix Referenceable, UIDCatalog to support references to non-Archetypes-based
-  content.
-  [toutpt]
-
-- Use the new `plone.uuid` package to generate UUIDs. The UID() method is now
-  an alias for ``IUUID(obj)``, which is the new preferred means of looking up
-  a UUID, since this can also work for non-Archetypes content. Archetypes
-  provides an IUUID() adapter that returns the value stored in the Archetypes
-  UID attribute. For new content, UUIDs are generated using
-  `plone.uuid.interfaces.IUUIDGenerator`, although old content will not (and
-  need not) be migrated.

-  When a value has been filled in and the form is redisplayed

-
-- The AT widget renderer has potentially very useful support for rendering a

-
-1.6a2 - 2009-11-17

-
-- Updated readme and fixed reST errors in changes.txt.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.6a1 - 2009-11-17
-------------------
-
-* Remove version.txt and functions that read it.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Modified the auto-generated type factories for compatibility with CMF 2.2.
-  The _constructInstance method of CMF FTI objects now takes care of raising
-  object events for old-style factories, so AT factories no longer raise
-  their own events.
-  [davisagli]
-
-* Restructured and restyled inandout widget to fix issue with rtl scripts.
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5660
-  [emanlove]
-
-* Replaced the css_slot with the style_slot, as the deprecated
-  css_slot is now really removed in Plone 4.
-  [maurits+maartenkling]
-
-* Sanitized the log message handling. Added a simple log module based on
-  Python's logging module. The log methods in the debug module calculate
-  the entire stack frame on *every* log call.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* "Categories" are now "Tags", in line with common usage and terminology.
-  [limi]
-
-* Changed the test_metadata tests regarding dates to change reasonable times.
-  Times around the year 1000 had somewhat different timezones.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Adjust to refactoring of CMFCatalogAware and PortalFolder's use of it.
-  [davisagli]
-
-* Fix for missing short-name field due to removal of globals.
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9429
-  [esteele]
-
-* Deprecated our own IOrderedContainer interface in favor of the version
-  from OFS. We do require Zope 2.7 for a while now ;)
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Declare package dependencies and fixed deprecation warnings for use
-  of Globals.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed PloneCompat module and moved transaction_note to utils.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed tabindex and Iterator from the template scopes. Their use was
-  discouraged long ago.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed utils.getPkgInfo and `__pkginfo__`. We use setuptools as our
-  distribution and package information platform.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed unsupported AggregatedStorage. You can easily convert this into
-  an add-on package if you use this storage.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Fixed remaining test failures caused by CMFPlone dependencies. Moved
-  normalizeString method to the edit view instead of requiring plone_utils.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Created a separate layer for Archetypes, that does not depend on the
-  Five ZCML layer anymore. AT tests can finally be run in isolation of other
-  installed packages. Fixed a couple of test failures which now have a
-  deterministic output.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed a couple of assert statements which wouldn't help in any way.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Changed all references to `here` in all templates to `context`.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed reference graph visualization based on graphviz. It is
-  unmaintained and certainly not a core feature.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* ``TextField._process_input doesn't forward **kwargs`` this fix
-  https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7597 [garbas]

-* Do not add empty schemas into a CompositeSchema anymore.
-  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7584.

-* Removed deprecated _guessPackage method. This closes
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7569.
-  [davisagli]
-
-* Normalizing the "id" attribute for fieldsets and fieldset legends, so
-  javascript schemata selection works for schematas that have spaces in
-  the title. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7999.
-  [rsantos]
-
-* Added a missing alt tag to the image in the file widget. This closes
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7763.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed the rebuild catalog tab from the reference and uid catalog. The
-  method is still there and can be accessed via the URL, but you won't
-  accidentally click on a tab in the ZMI anymore and have your catalog be
-  rebuilt without a warning. This closes
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8093.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Fixed the SelectionWidget view to keep the order of the passed in values
-  on output and not sort after arbitrary Python internal dict order. This
-  closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7272.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Fixed a macro expansion error when customizing templates which used
-  the folderlisting macro from base.pt. This closes
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6672.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Purged old Zope 2 Interface interfaces for Zope 2.12 compatibility.
-  Consider branching before this revision if release required before Plone 4.
-  [elro]
-
-* Avoid a failure in addCreator when called on an object without an
-  Acquisition chain.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Remove the long long deprecated 'type' class variable, which was
-  replaced with 'schema'.
-  [wichert]
-
-* Allow fields to supply their own PdataStreamIterator. This closes
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7572.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Fixed off-by-two error in transaction_note. This refs
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7610.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Add a new publish traverse that exposes image fields and their scales.
-  This removes the need for content types to have a __bobo_traverse__ method.
-  [wichert]
-
-* Move export/import step registrations to exportimport/configure.zcml. This
-  change requires CMF trunk.
-  [stefan]
-
-* Added dependencies to GenericSetup profile.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed five:implements statements from ZCML, which are already done in the
-  classes themselves.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Minor tweak in the calendar widget.
-  [deo, hannosch]
-
-* Converted Archetypes tests to use CMFTestCase as a base again, instead of
-  PloneTestCase. Fixed all tests / code to actually work without Plone
-  installed.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed Archetypes Site customization policy.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed deprecated code.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Moved rejectAnonymous script from CMFPlone over, as it is still used
-  inside base_metadata.cpt.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.5.16 - unreleased
---------------------
-
-* Fix the ImageWidget's preview_tag method to fetch the available scale
-  sizes correctly using the field's getAvailableSizes method, rather than
-  assuming its sizes attribute is a dictionary, since callables are allowed.
-  [davisagli]
-
-* Sanitize the behaviour of the 'alt' and 'title' attributes for the
-  image_field.tag function.
-  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8756.
-  [dukebody]
-

-  [hannosch]
-
-1.5.14 - 2010-01-14

-  0.00.  This closes http://dev.plone.org/old/plone/ticket/9414.
-  [kilobug, davisagli]
-
-* Pass request when testing validation in test_fields.
-  [ccrownhart, jnelson, tesdal]
-

-  help_expiration_date msgids. There is no new strings to translate.
-  See http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9633
-  [vincentfretin]
-
-1.5.12 - 2009-09-06
--------------------
-
-* Replaced fti/title_or_id by fti/Title in edit_macros.pt.
-  This fixes content type title translation when the i18n domain is different of plone.
-  Note that the Title method defined in Products.CMFCore.TypesTool.TypeInformation
-  takes care of id fallback if the title is not defined.
-  [vincentfretin]
-
-* Fix mapping for an i18n string in Field.validate_vocabulary. This closes
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9287
-  [vincentfretin]
-
-* BaseObject.getCharset() now supports extraction of the default_charset
-  for plain CMF sites.
-  [ajung]
-
-
-1.5.11 - 2009-03-30
--------------------
-
-* When saving an AT object only validate the visible fields in the schema.
-  (avoids hidden and invisible ones). Fixes
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7964
-  [massimo]
-
-* Fix XML validity in base_edit.

-* Fire WebDAVObjectInitializedEvent/WebDAVObjectEditedEvent when
-  content is created/edited via PUT/MKCOL. This is part of the fix
-  for http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7338
-  [sidnei]
-
-* A FixedPointField with a value between -1 and 0 (e.g. 0.5) is now
-  stored as (0, -5) and shown correctly instead of as +0.5.  This
-  closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7549

-* Don't bail if fieldsets is empty in 'base_edit'.  This closes
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7858
-  [nouri]
-
-* Backported the fix for id attribute of schematas with spaces.
-  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7999.
-  [rsantos]
-
-* Backported the fix for CatalogMultiplex.reindexObjectSecurity to check
-  for the specific CMF catalog interface before trying to update the
-  security stuff. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8271.
-  [deo]
-
-* Make ExtensibleMetadata implement the IMutableDublinCore interface.
-  [wichert]
-
-* Fixed small grammar error in Field.py validation message.
-  [hannosch]
-
-
-1.5.9 - 2008-07-02
-------------------
-
-* According to rfc1806 the header is Content-Disposition not
-  Content-disposition. Case matters, at least for IE6 (and results in
-  IE6-typical strange effects).
-  [jensens]
-
-* Add a new archetypes.edit.afterfieldsets viewlet manager which
-  can be used as a replacement of the extra_bottom slot on the edit
-  view.
-  [wichert]
-
-* Add 'keepReferencesOnCopy' option to ReferenceField, which allows
-  control over whether references of that field are copied on copy
-  or not.  This defaults to False.
-  [daftdog, nouri]
-
-* Backported the fix for the KeywordWidget 'checkbox' format support.
-  [deo]
-
-1.5.8 - 2008-04-21
-------------------
-
-* Fix code in 'Field.validate_vocabulary' that would validate a set
-  of values OK if the last element was in the vocabulary, but others
-  weren't.
-  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7809
-  [nouri]
-
-* Change BooleanField to return actual booleans instead of the raw value.
-  [wichert]
-
-* Fixed validation messages to translate the inner parts of the mappings
-  explicitly. This fixes the '${label_foo} is required, please correct.'
-  messages.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Remove invalid leading whitespace in hrefs.
-  [wichert]
-
-* Fixed NameError in Field.py when an error occurs in a transform. This
-  closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7905.
-  [hannosch, sidnei]
-
-* Add a new preview_scale property to ImageWidget. This is used by the edit
-  view when showing the image. If the scale is not present the previous
-  logic (only show if the image is <100kB in size) is used.
-  [wichert]
-
-* Add a new formQuestion class to field labels.
-  [dannyb]
-
-* Don't show the 'next' button if we allow tabbing, i.e. we're
-  displaying all schematas on the same page.
-  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6936
-  [nouri]
-
-1.5.7 - 2008-03-08
-------------------
-
-* Apply patch in http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7777
-  [nouri]
-
-* Fixed calculation of default fieldset when the "default" schemata only
-  contains invisible fields.
-  [witsch]
-
-1.5.6 - 2008-02-15
-------------------
-
-* Add a plone.locking unlock subscriber for IObjectInitializedEvent. This
-  ensures non portal_factory (and LinguaPlone translations) are unlocked
-  after creation.
-  [ldr]
-
-* Show the plone.abovecontentbody viewlets once per body instead
-  of once per field.
-  [wichert]
-
-* Add checkbox in updateSchemaForm to remove the instance schemas.
-  This is possibly needed when going from Archetypes 1.5.1 or
-  earlier to a newer version.  Should be safe unless you know that
-  you have content items with local schemata that you need to keep.
-  [maurits]
-
-* In mkDummyInContext use _setObject instead of setattr.  This means
-  dummy content in the tests shows up when using
-  context.objectIds().
-  [maurits]
-
-* Remove test dependency on ArchetypesTestUpdateSchema as this does
-  not work on Zope > 2.7.  Unused tests removed.
-  [maurits]
-
-* Changed 'form.inlineForm' in 'archetypes_kss/at.kss' to use
-  'kssSubmitForm' instead of simply 'currentForm'. This is needed
-  to support multi-valued form variables in inline editing.
-  This is dependent on http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/changeset/9200
-  [raphael]
-
-* Calling `getDefault` twice is unnecessarily slow and could potentially
-  cause bugs when a `default_method` returning an object is used for the
-  field.  In that case the field would get initialized with one instance,
-  but a second, different instance would be returned from the call to `get`.
-  [witsch]
-
-1.5.5 - 2007-12-29
-------------------
-
-* If allow_discussion is set as an attribute on a content type class,
-  ExtensibleMetaData.allowDiscussion() may hit a bug in CMF 2.1.0's
-  CMFDefault.DiscussionTool.overrideDiscussionFor() that tries to delete
-  a missing attribute, causing an AttributeError. This may be avoided by
-  using GS instead of a class attribute to control discussion on the
-  type, but there's no reason I can see to break old code. Fixed by
-  catching exception. Closes http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/761
-  [smcmahon]
-
-* Archetypes should inform the widgets when processing the form in the
-  validation phase.
-  This closes http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/760
-  [deo]
-
-* Backported the fixes from r8665 and r8804: zope.i18n.translate calls
-  should use the request, not the instance itself as the context.
-  [deo]
-
-1.5.4 - 2007-11-07
-------------------
-
-* Made the getSelection method in browser/widgets.py return the selection
-  in the character set of the vocabulary -- not the input value.
-  Fixes issue #759, UnicodeDecodeError with selection/multiselection
-  widgets.
-  [smcmahon]
-
-* CalendarWidget would not return a value without JavaScript support from
-  calendar_formfield.js. This is disabled for unauthenticated users in
-  Plone 3. Added a process_form override method to CalendarWidget to
-  assemble the input components.
-  [smcmahon]
-
-* Revert http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/changeset/8683 - Dont skip the
-  'metadata' schema in base_edit. Wichert and I agreed thats this is
-  wrong. Specially inside a bug-fix release. If theres a good reason to
-  remove the metadata from fieldsets, we can do it in the next release.
-  The UI was broken as well, btw.
-  [jensens, wiggy]
-
-1.5.3 - 2007-10-07
-------------------
-
-* Skip the 'metadata' schema in base_edit, like we used to do it
-  pre-1.5.  Also, do not render fieldset and legend elements when
-  we're only displaying one fieldset, i.e. the 'default' one.
-  [nouri]
-
-* Provide bbb alias for ReferenceEngine.UIDCatalog. This closes
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6507.
-  [hannosch, naro]
-
-* Restore use of the defaultLanguage method for the language field and
-  undeprecate it. This is done for two reasons: there is no alternative
-  to this feature, which LinguaPlone requires, and there never was a
-  deprecation warning.
-  [wichert]
-
-* Fix clicking on the "next" or "previous" button raises
-  'Non-existing fieldset: None'.
-  http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/754
-  [encolpe]
-
-* Forward-ported the disable-delete-option-when-required feature of image
-  widgets from 1.4.
-  [mj]
-
-* Re-added UIDCatalog import to ReferenceEngine for sites migrating from
-  Plone 2.1 (where the UIDCatalog is a class in that module).
-  [mj]
-
-1.5.2 - 2007-09-12
-------------------
-
-* Changed browser/configure.zcml to update unnecessarily restrictive
-  permissions for two widget views. These were requiring ModifyPortalContent
-  even though they exposed no private information, thus making the widgets
-  less useful outside Archetypes.
-  [smcmahon]
-
-* Made OrderedContainer implement OFS.interfaces.IOrderedContainer.  Fixes
-  bug #7084 in Plone issue tracker.
-  [rocky]
-
-* Update schema handling code to always use self.Schema() to get the current
-  schema and never (re)set self.schema.
-  [wichert]
-
-* Fix the change made in 1.5.1 which produced invalid XHTML
-  [limi]
-
-1.5.1 - 2007-09-10
-------------------
-
-* Updating the AT widget views to be rendered inline, so they can be
-  invoked in View mode by KSS without any special magic. This is a
-  prerequisite for bug #6705 in the Plone issue tracker.
-  [limi]
-
-1.5.0 - 2007-08-16
-------------------
-
-* ImageField.set used 'size' attribute instead of 'get_size' API.
-
-* added support for default DCMI "Right" using the portal_metadata
-  tool. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5831.
-  Remark: overall support of portal_metadata is very poor.
-  [jensens]
-
-* Removed hard dependency on the plone.locking package.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed a hard dependency on the plone.i18n package in Field.py.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Don't attempt to convert to 'text/plain' in
-  Archetypes.Field.FileField.getIndexable if there's no path to it.
-  This avoids loading the whole file contents into memory for these
-  cases.
-  [nouri, drjnut]
-
-1.5.0-rc3 - 2007-07-27
-----------------------
-
-* Fixed the msgid for the description of the location field. This closes
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6797.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.5.0-rc2 - 2007-07-13
-----------------------
-
-* Added a special fieldproperty type for reference fields, with a more
-  generic base class for any field accessors/mutators that need to acquire
-  tools. This uses a workaround for the fact that not all tools are
-  utilities (yet) and acquisition doesn't work properly in property
-  descriptors.
-  [optilude]
-
-* Fixed allowDiscussion handling in ExtensibleMetadata.
-  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5977.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.5.0-rc1 - 2007-07-04
-----------------------
-
-* Removed all utility registrations.
-  [hannosch, wichert]
-
-* Fix incorrect test for value added to a display list. This fixes
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6634
-  [wichert]
-
-* Corrected wrong i18n markup in edit_macros. This closes
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6583.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Updated keywords related i18n messages to reflect their new name.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.5.0-b5 - 2007-05-05
----------------------
-
-* Never validate fields that are not writeable.
-  [optilude]
-
-* Remove colors from log entries.
-  [wichert]
-
-1.5.0-b4 - 2007-04-28
----------------------
-
-* Added an ATDateTimeFieldProperty version of the ATFieldProperty mentioned
-  below. This takes care of conversion between Zope 2 DateTime's and Python
-  datetime objects.
-  [optilude]
-
-* Convert filename to ASCII in Content-Disposition header on
-  download. This fixes #620.
-  [nouri]
-
-* Added Products.Archetypes.fieldproperty.ATFieldProperty, which can be
-  used analogously to zope.schema.fieldproperty.FieldProperty for Archetypes
-  fields. See the doctest in that module for details.
-  [optilude]
-
-* Added an at_textarea_widget view and used it instead of the checkSelected,
-  unicodeEncode and lookupMime scripts on the textarea and visual widgets.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Replaced the getSelectionWidgetSelected script introduced in beta2 with the
-  at_selection_widget browser view. This allows us to use a Python generator
-  and safes us from iterating over all values in the vocabulary, when the
-  first value is already the selected one.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Make the boolean widget work correctly with or without javascript.
-  [elvix]
-
-* Removed the default value for starting_year from the CalendarWidget. This
-  ensures the value can be looked up dynamically from the properties.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Disable the content border when an object is being added using
-  portal_factory. These tabs don't make sense in an "add form" scenario,
-  and were causing errors.
-  [optilude]
-
-1.5.0-b3 - 2007-03-20
----------------------
-
-* Refactored installation code. This is now based on a GenericSetup extension
-  profile instead of the old Extensions/Install.py way.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed tests/runalltests.py and tests/framework.py as they have
-  outlived their usefulness. To run tests use Zope's testrunner:
-  ./bin/zopectl test --nowarn -s Products.Archetypes
-  [stefan]
-
-* Added the Location element (also known as Coverage in Dublin Core) to the
-  standard metadata set. This allows lots of interesting things like
-  geotagging of images, location notices on news items, etc.
-  [limi]
-
-1.5.0-b2 - 2007-03-05
----------------------
-
-* Added a new LanguageWidget that does the same as the SelectionWidget but
-  does not try to translate the vocabulary using the normal translation
-  machinery. It should use the Zope 3 locales information instead.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Speed up the selection widget considerably by calculating the selected
-  values ones and not for every value in the selection using a new
-  getSelectionWidgetSelected script.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Modernized some code in checkSelected and unicodeEncode scripts.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed explicit invocations of the translate script from various
-  vocabulary widgets. The getValue method of a vocabulary returns a Message
-  which can be translated by the usual TAL engine.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Allow field defaults to be looked up using an adapter of the instance
-  to IFieldDefaultProvider, with a name that is the same as the field name
-  in question (only if no default or default_method was set for that
-  field). This allows dynamically determined, context-sensitive defaults
-  without having to add a method into the class itself.
-  [optilude]
-
-* Make it possible to use vocabulary_factory for fields, giving the name
-  of a Zope 3 style named IVocabularyFactory utility. This means that
-  Archetypes fields can use more general Zope 3 vocabularies, and share them
-  with e.g. formlib forms.
-  [optilude]
-
-1.5.0-b1 - 2007-02-27
----------------------
-
-* Fixed deprecation warnings for minimalpath in skins install code.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Updated error message handling in validation to use Zope3-style translation,
-  which is available in the latest PTS.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* FileField is now a bit cleverer about indexing.  If you set a file
-  field to be 'searchable' it will now per default attempt to
-  convert it to plain text on indexing.
-  [nouri]
-
-* Replaced status message handling with new approach based on
-  Products.statusmessages. This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6131.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Automatic title to id generation is now optionally based on the plone.i18n
-  package instead of requiring the plone_tool.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Merged the plip174-reusable-i18n branch. This adds the optional ability to
-  control the language metadata on objects by an utility approach based on
-  plone.i18n.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.5.0-a2 - 2007-02-06
----------------------
-
-* Removed the typeDescription and typeDescMsgId attributes from all content
-  classes. These were only used on the edit form which has been altered to
-  use the Description method from the type information instead.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed some BBB code in generator/i18n.py.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Adjusted some code to work better with the CMF 2.1 tools as utilities work.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Fix failing test in traversal.txt:184, where an acquired template
-  overrode a view.  Added logic to BaseObject.__bobo_traverse__ to
-  make sure the right order is respected.
-  [nouri]
-
-* Turned off debug mode for writeable checks on fields per default, as this
-  caused a major performance problem with KSS.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Made it work with the kss merge in. Some templates are modified,
-  extra markup is added and a kss decorator view is defined that is
-  overwritten if kss is loaded. Currently the addability support in
-  the reference and inandout widgets has its javasacript commented
-  out, this needs to get fixed asap.
-  [ree]
-
-* By default base_edit will show all fields of all schemas on one page now.
-  The old behaviour can be kept by marking a content type with the
-  IMultiPageSchema interface.
-  [fschulze]
-
-* Made ATSiteTestCase inherit its layer from PloneTestCase.
-  [stefan]
-
-* Fixed a DeprecationWarning for listContentTypes(by_metatype=1).
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.5.0-a1 - 2006-10-25
----------------------
-
-* Cleaned up event usage: IObjectCreatedEvent is now fired during generated
-  constructor, and two custom events are fired during processForm() -
-  IObjectInitializedEvent and IObjectEditedEvent. Both inherit from
-  IObjectModifiedEvent, and the Initialized event is fired on the first
-  save, whereas the Edited event is fired on subsequent saves.
-  [optilude]
-
-* Applied patch from George Lee and modernised code a bit for Zope 2.10,
-  to support event-based pre- and post-validation. See interfaces/_event.py
-  [optilude]
-
-* Cleaned up VarClassGen a bit to make it potentially useful for people
-  needing it as part of a custom ISchema adapter.
-  [optilude]
-
-* Made it possible to look up AT schema using an adapter from self
-  to ISchema. See note in Schema/factory.py.
-  [whit, optilude]
-
-* Fix #585 by providing the right arguments for testCondition in templates.
-  [nouri]
-
-* Added small optimizations for DisplayLists to not translate values of type
-  Message by itself, added some tests.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Deprecated explicit msgid attributes on DisplayLists. Store Zope3 Messages
-  directly as values instead to get the same behavior.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Deprecated the generator.i18n module. We use the translate method of the
-  GlobalTranslationService directly for now, as long as we support
-  PlacelessTranslationService. Ultimately this should be replaced by calls
-  to 'from zope.i18n import translate'
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed outdated message catalogs and changed the few remaining texts in the
-  'archetypes' domain to use the 'plone' domain instead. The translation
-  files can be found as usual as part of the PloneTranslations product.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Changed BaseObject and ExtensibleMetadata to use new Message approach for
-  internationalization of labels and descriptions.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Optimized the basic widget for the new default case of labels and
-  descriptions as Messages. These are not translated automatically anymore
-  but this is delayed to be triggered by the time they are rendered in a TAL
-  context. This will ultimately safe quite some translation machinery hackery.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Modernized DisplayLists to use isinstance instead of type checking. Now
-  derived string types like Messages are allowed as keys and values as well.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed last bits of dependency version checks from __init__.py as well as
-  support for INSTALL_DEMO_TYPES. These types are not meant to be used in a
-  live site but only serve as code examples and are used during test runs.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Renamed sample_content profile to sample_types as it only includes types
-  but no content ;) This profile is not registered globally anymore but only
-  during test runs, as these types aren't meant to be used for anything else.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Marked Base* as implementing their Z3 interfaces.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Based tests on PloneTestCase with extension profile support for site setup.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Added (Default) alias to base_view to all sample types, so calling them will
-  still work in CMF >= 2.0.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed deprecated spec argument from listFolderContents and
-  folderlistingFolderContents of BaseFolderMixin.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Changed import of TAL.ndiff to zope.tal.ndiff.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Cleaned up XXX comments, converted non-critical ones to TODO.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed five:traversable from configure.zcml as it is not needed anymore for
-  Zope 2.10, which we require now.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Cleaned up some comments, removed a pdb and an unused zLOG import.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed some more BBB code.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed deprecated ArchetypesTestCase.py.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Adjusted rest tests to Zope2.10 output.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Remove BBB code for calendar_macros.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.4.5 unreleased
-----------------
-
-* Encode values in Field.toString so we do not fall over fields with
-  unicode default values that contain non-ASCII text.
-  [wichert]
-
-* Fixed possible Unicode problem in BaseObject's SearchableText. This
-  closes http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/720.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.4.3 - 2011-05-21
-------------------
-
-* Add an ObjectModifiedEvent right after `initializeArchetype`,
-  since that modifies the object with default values defined in the
-  schema.
-  [nouri]
-
-* Fix http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/712: Do not put security
-  declarations on a ComputedAttribute, or on 'def content_type(self)'.
-  [mj]
-
-* BooleanWidget always displays 'True' and 'False'. This is very IT-centric!
-  In real world people prefer 'Yes' and 'No' - or custom settings. Latter was
-  fixed before, but Archetypes should have a sane default behaviour, so its
-  now changed to display 'Yes' and 'No' - and is l10n aware.
-  [jensens]
-
-* BooleanWidget offers to show something different than True/ False in view
-  macro using a vocabulary. Unfortunally it passed a boolean to the
-  DisplayList, which raised a TypeError. Now we pass the string
-  representations 'True' and 'False using 'str(key)', so one can define
-  a vocabulary like [('True', 'Yes'), ('False', 'No')].
-  [jensens]
-
-* Fix http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/686: "zid.pt does not
-  respect the portal wide visible_ids setting".
-  [nouri]
-
-* The last change expected portal_type global available. This is true for all
-  good archetypes products ;-) but failed with CacheSetup, where editmacros
-  was called w/o setting it. Archetypes now ignores this missing global and
-  inititalize it to 'unknowntype'.
-  [jensens]
-
-* for better css styling hpeter added a class and a id to edit_macros form
-  element, which enables per-type styling of base_edit.
-  [jensens]
-
-* Fix unicodeEncode skin method to deal with sequences; fixes SelectionWidget
-  with underlying LinesField case where the current value was not reflected
-  in the edit widget. Fixes issue #705.
-  [mj]
-
-* BaseContent.PUT will now also fire the object modified event.
-  [nouri]
-
-* Update the base folder types to use sane permissions for
-  manage_copyObjects, manage_pasteObjects, manage_renameObject(s)
-  rather than the default 'View management screens' given by
-  OFS.CopySupport (the permission mapping used is from
-  Plone.PloneFolder)
-  [alecm]
-
-* Backported the catalog unindexing silencer code from trunk, as in contrast
-  to the former code on this branch it doesn't use any private attributes.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Fixed translation domain of two messages in go_back.cpy. These were missing
-  from the Archetypes translation files.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.4.2-final - 2006-12-15
-------------------------
-
-* Fixed missing declaration of timestamp property in TextAreaWidget for
-  append_only mode.
-  It may need a better intregration of plone datetime format property.
-  [encolpe]
-
-* Fixed missing i18n statement for the text format label on visual widgets.
-  This closes http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/687.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Fixed a minor issue of FixedPointField: It now works with integer default
-  value.
-  [jensens]
-
-* Add a try: finally: clause in AllowedTypesByIfaceMixin when deleting
-  the typeinfo "temporarily" Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5314
-  [alecm]
-
-* Fix the unique name finder during initial rename on create so that it
-  checks the names validity.  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5044
-  [alecm]
-
-* Fix BaseObject.isBinary to not assume AttributeStorage.  Fixes
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5822
-  [alecm]
-
-* Silenced more catalog unindexing log error messages by checking if
-  an object exists in the catalog before uncataloging.
-  [rocky]
-
-* Fixed #5963. Now all the first headers of the page have
-  "documentFirstHeading" class applied.
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5963
-  [spliter]
-
-* Fixed #5929. UID catalog rebuild broke path convention.
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5929.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Made tests use layers for AT site setup.
-  [stefan]
-
-1.4.1-final - 2006-09-08
-------------------------
-
-* Fix #635.  Large files were truncated on `setFileName`.  In
-  `setFilename` of FileField, we now set the `filename` attribute
-  directly instead of retrieving the BaseObject, setting the
-  filename and setting the object again.
-  [nouri]
-
-* Fixed log_exc function in debug.py to print the actual exception including
-  the traceback.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* base_edit (anything calling processForm, actually) now fires off
-  appropriate IObjectCreatedEvent and IObjectModifiedEvent zope 3 events
-  [rocky]
-
-* Made the BaseObject __bobo_traverse__ fallback on Five traversal except in
-  those cases where it would return something different.  This allows views
-  to override acquired attributes. (this change is not intended for Zope 2.10,
-  which behaves differently)
-  [alecm]
-
-* Fixed simple xhtml non-compliance and some erroneous i18n markup.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Make all WebDAV request types return NullResources on failure, not just PUT
-  and MKCOL.  This fixes a test failure resulting from some Zope traversal
-  machinery tweaks.  Thanks to sidnei for webdav guidance.
-  [alecm]
-
-* Safari uses HTTP_ACCEPT=='*/*', which meant that the image widget never
-  rendered an image due to some faulty boolean logic.
-  [alecm]
-
-* Backport of fix for #585 from trunk
-  [nouri]
-
-* Add a multiple catalog aware reindexObjectSecurity to BaseObject. This
-  fixes problems with security checks in catalogs when objects are changed
-  through other means than normal editing (such as workflow changes).
-  [wichert]
-
-* Fix #670: addCreator function fails with AttributeError in
-  ExtensibleMetadata.  This closes
-  http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/670
-  [nouri]
-
-1.4.0-final - 2006-06-16
-------------------------
-
-* Undeprecated 'public', there are too many products relying on it and it's
-  just a name change without any real benefit.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.4.0-RC1 - 2006-06-02
-----------------------
-
-* Use zope.contenttype in favor of zope.app.content_types if available.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Added a new GenericSetup profile 'sample_content' which installs all
-  available sample content types. This should mainly be used as a basis for
-  the test setup.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.4.0-beta1 - 2006-05-12
-------------------------
-
-* Added support for <catalog> entries to be added to the GenericSetup
-  profile description of portal types to enable registration w/ multiple
-  catalogs in the archetype_tool.
-  [rafrombrc]
-
-* Fixed a problem in Field.py which could split mutibyte characters at a wrong
-  position, which could cause encoding problem in mimetypes_registry.
-  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5214.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Add GenericSetup support for importing/exporting the catalog map from
-  ArchetypeTool
-  [wichert]
-
-* Use portal type instead of meta type for the catalog map. Add an option
-  to config.py to switch back to the old behaviour.
-  [wichert]
-
-* Removed some old commented out code.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Added a archetypes historyaware mixin, providing access to archetypes
-  persistent revisions (including annotations).
-  [mj]
-
-* Moved 'index_method' computation out from Extensions/utils.py into
-  Field.  Because we want SearchableText of BaseObject to use the
-  'index_method' too.  This fixes
-  http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/645
-  [nouri]
-
-* Avoid DeprecationWarnings for manageAddDelete methods and converted the
-  logging infrastructure to use Python's logging module in favor of zLOG.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Removed reST-test-kludge. reStructuredText of Zope < 2.8 is buggy,
-  don't bother with test failures.
-  [stefan]
-
-* converted remaining interfaces and unconverted metadata due to
-  issues with CMF1.5's bridges
-  [whit]
-
-* converted add following modules to zope3 interfaces w/
-  backward bridges::
-  interfaces/_annotations.py
-  interfaces/_field.py
-  interfaces/_layer.py
-  interfaces/_marshall.py
-  interfaces/_metadata.py
-  interfaces/_referenceengine.py
-  interfaces/_schema.py
-  interfaces/_storage.py
-  [whit]
-
-* added makeBridgeMaker, makeZ3Bridges, and makeZ2Bridges to util to
-  assist in bridging
-  [whit]
-
-* removed superfluous bridge statements from zcml
-
-* Spring-cleaning of tests infrastructure.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.4.0-alpha03 - 2006-03-26
---------------------------
-
-* Fixed some bizarro bug where the __call__ method of BaseFolder (i.e.
-  render the default view) was instantiating a new CMFCore PortalFolderBase
-  object and returning it (unrendered even).
-  [alecm]
-
-* fixes #617: Do not catch KeyboardInterrupt.
-  [jensens]
-
-* marked PhotoField as deprecated. After work done on ATImage and
-  ImageField this one isnt needed anymore in Archetypes core.
-  PhotoField and its supporting classes will be removed in AT 1.5
-  [jensens]
-
-* fixed #600: Auto-generated attributes are not protected by
-  permissions. Attention: Enabling protection is a minor change in
-  the config.py. Some products with code doing direct attribute
-  access will break. People using and relying on those products
-  can disable attribute protection, but better fix those Products.
-  [jensens]
-
-* fixed #608: Protect id field by 'Copy or Move'
-  [jensens]
-
-* fixed #637: Schema.moveField( ... after ) does incorrect reordering.
-  Needed fixing of a buggy doctest.
-  [jensens]
-
-* merged in code of Daniel Nouri to support multiple references
-  with the same name between two objects, thsi is needed for example
-  with Relations product. Thx Daniel.
-  [jensens]
-
-* removed superfluos code from ClassGen.
-  [jensens]
-
-* Removed some nonsense on PUT that would look at REQUEST._steps and
-  try to catch a exception (which would never occur!). Made it use
-  'PATH_INFO' instead, with a fallback to 'self.getId()' which
-  should suffice (PATH_INFO is always available as long as the
-  request came in through ZPublisher.Publish).
-  [sidnei]
-
-* PdataStreamIterator could potentially end up loading a persistent
-  object after the ZODB connection had been closed. Made it use a
-  temporary file to stream out the content so that large files don't
-  end up using all the available memory.
-  [sidnei]
-
-1.4.0-alpha02 - 2006-02-23
---------------------------
-
-* Added check for duplicate 'accessor', 'edit_accessor' and
-  'mutator' method names on a schema's fields. Helps Joe Schmoe to
-  get unstuck, hopefully.
-  [sidnei]
-
-* dont generate 'Schema' method any more. its now part of BaseObject.
-  [jensens]
-
-* seperated UIDCatalog from ReferenceEngine.
-  [jensens]
-
-1.4.0-alpha01 - 2006-01-26
---------------------------
-
-* Remove BBB code for CMFBTreeFolder import location.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Make import from ``Products.Archetypes.atapi import *`` default and deprecate
-  public.
-  [jensens]
-
-* Integrated 'generator' into Archetypes.
-  [jensens]
-
-* Changed transactions use to new API and removed some Plone 2.0 backwards
-  compatibility code
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Changed imports of CMFCore.CMFCorePermissions to CMFCore.permissions
-  [k_vertigo, hannosch]
-
-* DisplayLists should be a little less strict on their values. Now not only
-  unicode itself but also types inherited from unicode are allowed. This is
-  needed to handle zope.i18nmessageid.MessageID objects correctly.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.3.10-final2 - 2006-09-14
---------------------------
-
-* Check mimetype before schema update and reapply type after. This fixes
-  http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/618
-  [alecm]
-
-* Fixed import of NotFound in getBestIcon.py which broke CMF1.4 compatibility.
-  This closes http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/656.
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.3.9-final - 2006-05-16
-------------------------
-
-* Add a new generateNewId method to BaseObject which is used to suggest
-  a new id when automatically renaming an object after creation. This makes
-  it easier to used custom naming in derived types.
-  [wichert]
-
-* Fix visual widget to not lose formatting if there's only one allowed
-  content type - without passing this variable along, the field will revert
-  to text/plain or MIME type guessing the second time it's saved.
-  [optilude]
-
-1.3.8-final - 2006-04-30
-------------------------
-
-* Cleanup of CatalogMultiplex: removed superfluos code, added docstring
-  and comments.
-  [jensens]
-
-* Moved 'index_method' computation out from Extensions/utils.py into
-  Field.  Because we want SearchableText of BaseObject to use the
-  'index_method' too.  This fixes
-  http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/645
-  [nouri]
-
-* Removed reST-test-kludge. reStructuredText of Zope < 2.8 is buggy,
-  don't bother with test failures.
-  [stefan]
-
-* Fixed WebDAV MOVE breaking references and cleaned up flagging of
-  reference copying for good measure.
-  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/642
-  [sidnei]
-
-* Fixed up some templates that were abusing tabindexes to get unique ids on
-  form elements. Tabindexes can no longer be used for this reliably
-  since Plone 2.1.3, and repeat/var/number is cleaner anyway.
-  [optilude]
-
-* fixed http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5072
-  [jensens]
-
-* fixed #637: Schema.moveField( ... after ) does incorrect reordering.
-  Needed fixing of a buggy doctest.
-  [jensens]
-
-* Removed some nonsense on PUT that would look at REQUEST._steps and
-  try to catch a exception (which would never occur!). Made it use
-  'PATH_INFO' instead, with a fallback to 'self.getId()' which
-  should suffice (PATH_INFO is always available as long as the
-  request came in through ZPublisher.Publish).
-  [sidnei]
-
-* PdataStreamIterator could potentially end up loading a persistent
-  object after the ZODB connection had been closed. Made it use a
-  temporary file to stream out the content so that large files don't
-  end up using all the available memory.
-  [sidnei]
-
-* Changed sidneis last 'fix'. Dont raise an exception. This is changed
-  behaviour and I cant accept this in a bugfix release. Prints out
-  a deprecation message instead now, to not break Products relying on
-  the old - odd - behaviour.
-  [jensens]
-
-* Added check for duplicate 'accessor', 'edit_accessor' and
-  'mutator' method names on a schema's fields. Helps Joe Schmoe to
-  get unstuck, hopefully.
-  [sidnei]
-
-* Backported fix for failing Windows mime types:
-  Original fix: http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/changeset/6005
-  Bug details here: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5109
-  [limi]
-
-* Cleanup of CatalogMultiplex: removed superfluos code, added docstring
-  and comments.
-  [jensens]
-
-* Fixed missing import of PersistentMapping.
-  Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5182
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Usability fix for file widget ( widgets/file.pt ) so that the
-  radiobuttons with 'Keep existing file' and similar are no longer shown
-  if there is no file uploaded.
-
-* fixed bug in getBestIcon.py, use NotFound class but not 'NotFound'
-  string in exception.
-  [panjunyong]
-
-* fixed bug in AllowedTypesByIface, prevented to copy, paste, rename
-  objects using the mixin.
-  [jensens]
-
-* fixed problems introduced by last 'fix' of IdWidget zid.pt: Member
-  and widget settings was ignored :-(
-  [jensens]
-
-1.3.7-final - 2006-01-16
-------------------------
-
-* fixed problems with IDWidget ignore_visible_ids in some setups.
-  [sidnei, rafrombrc]
-
-1.3.6-final - 2006-01-07
-------------------------
-
-* enable IDWidget to ignore global visible_ids setting and enable ids by
-  adding a property ignore_visible_ids=False (default). If it is True
-  the id (short name) is shown and the global or by-member setting is
-  ignored. This is useful for types where control over the id is needed.
-  [jensens]
-
-* 'Renderer' is used to set locals to context of rendered widgets. added
-  prefix support for fieldnames in widgets to enable archetypes for multi-
-  object edit forms.
-  [jensens]
-
-* debug.ClassLog -> generateFrames calls pythons 'inspect' function. This
-  breaks on at least one OS-X Tiger system with an IndexError (normal setup).
-  Now IndexError is catched and ignored.
-  [jensens]
-
-* cleanup of install_indexes magic to add index and metadata-columns to
-  a catalog. also added an alternative method than 'schema()' to use, for
-  example if a CatalogTool itself is archetypes based. The alternative i
-  method is 'zcschema' and does not conflict with Archetypes schema
-  attribute.
-  [jensens]
-
-* Moved the byline to the header to be consistent with Plone 2.1.
-  [limi]
-
-1.3.6-RC1 - 2005-12-29
-----------------------
-
-* Make rename-after-creation resolve duplicates by appending -n, where n is
-  a number, to the id when an existing object exists in the parent folder.
-  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4510.
-
-* Return the new PdataStreamIterator when a Pdata-like chain is
-  found (we always assume this if the marshaller didn't return a
-  string). This way it works better with ExternalEditor.
-  [dreamcatcher]
-
-* PrimaryFieldMarshaller was overriding already computed 'length'
-  with len(data). Yuck.
-  [dreamcatcher]
-
-* Fixed http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4768 - wrong status message.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Fixed typo in BaseBTreeFolder.__init__. Thanks jenner.
-  [stefan]
-
-* Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4840. Resync some texts with Plone.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4981. BaseObject.__bobo_traverse__ now
-  also handles HEAD requests.
-  [stefan]
-
-* Made basically compatible with Zope 2.9 by using a wrapper around the
-  transaction module.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Lower the bar for making folderish content implement WebDAV/FTP
-  'PUT' and 'GET' by adding a new flag ``__dav_marshall__``  that
-  just needs to be flipped to 'True' for folderish content.
-  [dreamcatcher]
-
-* Finally changing the last toPortalTime call to toLocalizedTime
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Permission for setting creation date and modification date: Portal
-  Manager should it be allowed to set it manually!
-  [yenzenz]
-
-1.3.5-final - 2005-10-11
-------------------------
-
-* Fixed http://members.plone.org/collector/4709 __bobo_traverse__ calls
-  will not be passing a RESPONSE argument.
-  [alecm]
-
-* Fixed filename detection for temporary files on Windows.
-  [dreamcatcher]
-
-* Fixed [ 1289596 ]. Field.ImageField.tag did not escape alt and title
-  attributes.
-  [elro] [stefan]
-
-* Repaired ClassGen as to not stomp over declarePublic and
-  declarePrivate security declarations. Patch by Jens Vagelpohl.
-  [dreamcatcher]
-
-* Fixed some places where a session was being created nedlessly. Now
-  sessions will only be created when they are really used. I hope
-  this is the last occurrence.
-  [dreamcatcher]
-
-* Fixed at_post_create_script hook to only be called once (was previously
-  called after every edit) and added an at_post_edit_script hook to be
-  called on every subsequent edit (but not the first create/edit).
-  [elro]
-
-1.3.4-final - 2005-08-30
-------------------------
-
-* added tests if the test engine i working fine, this shows the effect
-  of http://plone.org/collector/4487 verbose.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* applied patch to BaseObject.unmarkCreationFlag() with unwanted
-  acquisition of at_post_create_script. thx Aparajita Fishman
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* enabled renaming of fields while copy them. it eases field recycling.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* fixed [ 1265581 ] Deleting a file withn optional FileField/FielWidget
-  breaks
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Fixed a number of issues related to the oversimplicity of
-  CatalogMultiplex.manage_after*.  Workflow state was not being reset on
-  object copy, which is a minor security issue.  Discussions were not being
-  removed from the catalog when the parent was deleted.  Copied discussions
-  were not being added to the catalog.  The owner local role was not being
-  set on copy.  CMFUid objects were not being removed on copy (critical for
-  CMFEditions).  CatalogMultiplex now delegates manage_after* methods to
-  CMFCatalogAware (except manage_afterClone which it overrides to do a full
-  reindex before delegating).  Removed calls in BaseFolder to
-  PortalFolder manage_after*, as those are just inherited directly from
-  CMFCatalogAware whose methods are now used in CatalogMultiplex.
-  [alecm]
-
-* Fixed an issue where copying a BaseBTreeFolder resulted in references on
-  subobjects of that folder being duplicated due to bad inheritance of
-  _getCopy.
-  [alecm]
-
-* download of files from FileField: filenames where cutted at
-  first space character in filename. report, fix/patch by
-  LaurenceRowe, thx!
-  [yenzenz]
-
-1.3.4-rc3 - 2005-08-07
-----------------------
-
-* import of CMFBTreeFolder changed with CMF 1.5.3, kept it backward
-  compatible. thx to TresEquis.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* FileField: On download provide a filename. Patch form Tim Hicks
-  applied. Needs optional UI to change filename, atm it uses the
-  name of the uploaded file. thx tim2p.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* theres no application/octet.  http://www.iana.org/assignments/
-  thanks to lalo for this pick.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-1.3.4-rc2 - 2005-08-01
-----------------------
-
-* Skip image scales with a size of (0,0)
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed handling of boolean usage in allowDiscussion for the CMF 1.5
-  DiscussionTool.
-  [alecm]
-
-* Fixed two Marshaller bugs. PrimaryFieldMarshaller wasn't using the mutator
-  for a field and RFC822 marshaller was trying to add field, image and
-  object fields to the header. Fields of these types contain binary data
-  or instances of OFS.Image.Image and can't be marshalled as header.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1209047 ] edit method broken on BaseBTreeFolder. Also added some
-  im_func fu to BaseBTreeFolder.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1236601 ] bug in method getAvailableSizes()
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed critical bug in RFC822 Marshaller w/ CMF 1.5 The
-  CMFDefault.utils.parseHeadersBody function capitalizes the header names
-  and breaks demarshalling. Marshall contains a light weight
-  reimplementation.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added ftests for id autogeneration.
-  [alecm]
-
-1.3.4-rc1 - 2005-07-17
-----------------------
-
-* Fixed http-etag test. It now 1) refreshs etag on reindexObject and 2) also
-  must update etag on metadata modification (like Title).
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Fixed bug when get full BaseUnit object from FileField
-  [panjunyong]
-
-* Fixed file edit widget to disable upload by default when javascript enabled
-  [panjunyong]
-
-* Fixed at_download to return values from field.download
-  [panjunyong]
-
-* Tiny change to image.pt widget template to render a link directly
-  to the image object
-  [rafrombrc]
-
-* Added Five/Zope3 interface bridges
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fix http://plone.org/collector/4268 Type descriptions were not
-  translated and fixed the usage of archetype_name in templates.
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Prefer isIDAutogenerated from plone_tool over the script if available.
-  [alecm]
-
-* some minor i18n tweaks
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Added options for PIL quality and resize algo to ImageField.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed #1212048: ReferenceField "set" broken for
-  BaseBTreeFolder-based objs.
-  [dpunktnpunkt]
-
-* Fixed #1230645: unnecessary call to str() method in SQLMethod.
-  [dpunktnpunkt]
-
-1.3.4-beta2 - 2005-07-06
-------------------------
-
-* Fixed outstanding errors with ImageField. ImageField is now using
-  the same api and processing methods as FileField. Empty images are
-  neither created nor returned by the accessor/mutator.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added a wrapper for indexing object in the uid catalog to fix unicode
-  issues.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added AllowedTypesByIface, a mix-in that allows you to restrict
-  allowed_content_types by interface.  We want a better way to do
-  this for 1.4.  ArchGenXML support is under way.
-  [dpunktnpunkt]
-
-* Reworked ArchetypeTool.listPortalTypesWithInterfaces.  Note that
-  the former version only returned AT types as well.
-  [dpunktnpunkt]
-
-* Moved mark creation flag code from ATContentTypes 1.0 to AT. This is the
-  right place for the code. It requires Plone 2.1 but doesn't barf if no or
-  and older version is installed.
-  [tiran, alecm]
-
-* As a part of the mark creation flag code the _renameAfterCreation()
-  method is added. It can be turned on by setting _at_rename_after_creation
-  to True. Thx to Alec Mitchell for his code!
-  [tiran, alecm]
-
-* Fixed issue with ImageField where an empty string was passed down to
-  PIL resulting in an exception.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Updated the type registration code to be compatible with CMF 1.5 and to
-  support method aliases and CMFDynamicViewFTI.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Made utils.filterTypes compatible with CMF 1.5
-  [tiran]
-
-* generalised the interface detetection for types and listings of it
-  in archetypes_tool and adapted TemplateMixin lists and detection to
-  use this code.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* calendar_slot has been renamed to calendar_macros in Plone
-  [hannosch]
-
-* Fixed failed test in ISchema: removed 'self' in interface method.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Expose field creators of ExtensibleMetadata.
-  [yenzenz, optilude, alecm]
-
-* Make it easy to rename fields and keep its content. Introduced a property
-  old_field_name. Patch from Kai Hoppert. Thx!
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Merged madduck-refactor-content-edit-1_3 branch r4283:4363 into
-  release-1_3-branch:
-  content_edit.cpy cannot be called directly by other .cpy scripts,
-  because FormController seems to bestow control upon content_edit.cpy on
-  invocation. This patch moves the code (unchaned) to content_edit_impl.py
-  and replaces content_edit.cpy with a simple call to this .py. As
-  a result, SQLWindowStorage can use AT's content_edit and needs no code
-  duplication, and AT continues to work as before.
-  For reference, please see:
-  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.zope.plone.archetypes.devel/4959
-  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.zope.plone.user/35620
-  [madduck]
-
-* Merged madduck-renderingfixes-1_3 branch r3956:4361 into
-  release-1_3-branch:
-  Reworked base_{view,edit} wrt CSS and Javascript. previously, CSS and
-  Javascript were both rendered into the javascript_head_slot and there
-  was no way to influence it really, other than on a per-field basis with
-  helper_css and helper_js. No way to do it per-type though. My patch
-  splits CSS into the css_slot and makes both templates look in the user
-  templates for optional CSS/Javascript macros ('css' and 'javascript')
-  much in the same way that the header/typedescription/body/footer parts
-  are acquired. For base_edit, this is trivial since edit_macros is
-  defined inside the css and javascript macros provided by the user (they
-  are evaluated in the context of base_edit itself, which defines
-  edit_macros). For base_view, this is not possible. Thus there is code
-  duplication, which I documented in the form of comments in the
-  templates.
-  Added a condition to the errors span for each field in widgets/field.pt
-  such that in the absence of an error, no HTML is generated. This avoids
-  some rendering problems when multiple widgets are to be rendered on the
-  same HTML line.
-  [madduck]
-
-* Introduced manage_afterPUT and manage_afterMKCOL hooks that are called
-  after a webdav or ftp PUT/MKCOL operation.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed MKCOL of BaseBTreeFolder to call the right MKCOL method from
-  BaseFolder resp. SkinnedFolder.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Moved document_actions above title on base.pt.
-  [deo]
-
-1.3.4-beta1 - 2005-05-20
-------------------------
-
-* Fixed [ 1192453 ] Typo in Extensions/utils.py on line 117. Thanks
-  to salmacis.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Solved unicode encoding problem on set of textfield.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Unquoted filename when uploaded from ftp/webdav.
-  [panjunyong]
-
-* Fixed [ 1184475 ] Template Mixin UI still borked.
-  Attention: All types are bound to portal_type know. If you're using
-  a type where meta_type!=portal_type you have to rebind your templates
-  to the type! This should affect not too many people.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Fix issue [ 1174598 ] default action title overrides custom title if
-  set using 'name' instead of 'title'.
-  [alecm]
-
-* Made the show_hm flag for CalendarWidget work.
-  [alecm]
-
-* Added hidden macro to boolean widget fixes issue [ 1144139 ].
-  [alecm]
-
-1.3.3-final - 2005-04-22
-------------------------
-
-* Changed default for Language metadata field to empty string (''). Also
-  removed the undesired fallback magic.
-  [stefan]
-
-* Fixed [ 1187630 ] AT rebuilds reference catalog by default on product
-  install.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-1.3.3-rc3 - 2005-04-21
-----------------------
-
-* Added optional 'visible_only' argument to Schemata.editableFields();
-  modified base_edit to use 'visible_only=True' so the edit form will
-  not display schemata that contain no visibly editable fields.  Default
-  behaviour for editableFields should remain the same.
-  [rafrombrc]
-
-* Applied two performance optimizations:
-  BaseObject.getCharset() no longer calls the PythonScript of same name.
-  This method is called bazillions of times and using a script here is
-  enormously wasteful. The script has been kept as fallback.
-  ExtensibleMetadata.listCreators() now calls getOwnerTuple() instead
-  of getOwner() to avoid lookup of user folder and user.
-  [stefan]
-
-1.3.3-rc2 - 2005-04-01
-----------------------
-
-* Fixed plone bug #3959 (http://plone.org/collector/3959), made
-  OrderedContainer.moveObjectsByDelta not throw an error when passed the id
-  of a non-contentish object.
-  [alecm]
-
-* Fixed [ 1061971 ] maintain order in InAndOut and PickLists across edits.
-  [alecm]
-
-* Fixed hidden variant of MultiSelectionWidget.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Changed warnings.warn(...) to deprecated(..) from Archetypes.debug.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Fixed [ 1171059 ] Archetypes should not set language explicitly on content.
-  Default is set to None by default. For backward compatibility reasons, I
-  added a switch in config to enable old behaviour.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Added subject to SearchableText.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added ComputedAttributes for effective_date and expiration_date.
-  [tiran]
-
-1.3.3-rc1 - 2005-03-25
-----------------------
-
-* Fixed [ 1163878 ] Field.toString() always return the same thing. Thanks
-  to flacoste for the patch.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Fixed [ 1153525 ] zid.pt hidden mode hardcode field name. Thanks to
-  flacoste for the patch.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Fixed Referencefield making it possible to completely avoid ugly paths in
-  the selectionlist (set vocabulary_display_path_bound=-1 to never get the
-  paths).
-  [elvix]
-
-* Fixed problem with encoding enforcement on TextField. Now has same behavior
-  as StringField, but is neutral to old behaviour. If you call 'get' on a
-  TextField and give a kwarg 'encoding' it has been ignored, now its used.
-  It returns the encoding requested.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Fixed [ 1160362 ] AT 1.3.2-final bug on PrimaryFieldMarshaller by adding the
-  missing import of shasattr in Marshall.
-  [tiran]
-
-* textarea.pt and image.pt were broken under 2.7.2 (newline in python
-  expression).
-  [gotcha]
-
-* Correct getMsgId on DisplayList (when using int keys) and IntDisplayList
-  Fixes [ 1159248 ] IntDisplayList.getValue triggers DeprecationWarning.
-  [gotcha]
-
-* Made ComputedFiled inherits from Field instead of ObjectField (which
-  should only be used with fields that handle storages).
-  [deo]
-
-1.3.2-final - 2005-03-05
-------------------------
-
-* Made deprecation warnings less verbose. If someone wants them, switch
-  DEBUG in config.py to True.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Added IntDisplayList to the public module.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added Sidney's AttributeValidator to BaseObject. It's disabled for now
-  because it might break third party software which relies on a broken
-  behavior. You can enable it by setting ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY to True.
-  [tiran]
-
-1.3.2-rc1 - 2005-02-26
-----------------------
-
-* Using registerType without a package name is deprecated. Explict is better
-  than implicit!
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed DisplayList for int keys. The warning module was missing *blush*
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added IntDisplayList to utils.py. Also I've coded some nice doc tests for
-  DisplayList and IntDisplayList.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed[ 1118780 ] Bad validation for required IntegerFields with value zero
-  Also the default values for IntegerField and FloatField are None instead of
-  0.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Applied patch from [ 1076738 ] PrimaryFieldMarshaller: wrong length.
-  [dmaurer]
-
-* Changed the reference tab permission to modify or review according to
-  [ 1087990 ] 'References' action visible for everyone.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed customizationpolicy.py not to break if CMFPlone isn't available.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Updated the requirements to Zope 2.7.4+. It may work with older versions of
-  Zope 2.7.4 but due some serious memory leaks and some important bug fixes
-  you should really use Zope 2.7.4!
-  [tiran]
-
-* Backported CMFTestCase/PloneTestCase based test suite from AT 1.4 branch to
-  AT 1.3. The unit test suite of AT 1.3 was horrible. Yeah you are allowed to
-  beat me up but in excuse I must say it was first try in using ZopeTestCase.
-  I've learned my lessons. In order to run the unit tests you have to install
-  either CMF 1.4.7 + CMFTestCase + ZopeTestCase or Plone 2.0.5 + PloneTestCase
-  + ZopeTestCase. For now only the CVS versions from sf.net collective are
-  working properly.
-  To run the unit tests go into the root of your testing instance and run:
-  ZOPE_HOME/bin/test.py -v -C etc/zope.conf --libdir Products/Archetypes/
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1103955 ] ObjectManager raises (usually) AttributeError.
-  [dmaurer]
-
-* Fixed [ 1074236 ] DDocument and Fact are broken in 1.3.1 final.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1093042 ] log warning for int keys in DisplayList.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1067212 ] missing security declaration for
-  BaseFolder.manage_addFolder.
-  [biza]
-
-* Fixed [ 1114892 ] should set to field, not fieldname in
-  ObjectField.getRaw().
-  [madduck]
-
-* More OrderedDict fixes... wasn't overriding 'pop' method from base class,
-  causing keys list and data to get out of sync if it were ever called.
-  [rafrombrc]
-
-* Fixed broken implementation of moveObjectsByDelta in ordered base folder
-  by copying my code from CMFPlone. I've fixed it in Plone over an year ago
-  but I forgot to fix it in AT.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1114362 ] use format name instaed that mime type inside RichWidget.
-  [dan_t]
-
-* Filtering schemata from showing up on base_edit unless user actually
-  has edit privs to some of the fields.
-  [rafrombrc]
-
-* Fixed utils.OrderedDict problems:
-  - constructor was failing w/ non-empty argument
-  - infinite loop when copy() was called
-  [rafrombrc]
-
-* Changed UI for Image/File widgets. Should be a lot better now.
-  [_ender_]
-
-* BaseUnit backward compability on very old bad migrated Archetypes 1.0
-  sites. Thanks to Brent M Hendricks <brentmh@rice.edu>.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Commented out the View/Edit links for ordinary display - feel free to
-  enable these in your site, but they should definitely not be there by
-  default.
-  [limi]
-
-* Added the last (and only) info that isn't being handled by AT for FTI:
-  allow_discussion. Now you can define it at class level, as any other
-  FTI property. The module level modify_fti method still exists for any
-  advanced configuration.
-  [deo]
-
-* Improved test for [ 1003868 ] to demonstrate the real problem:
-  default_charset isn't respected. Now when db_encoding isn't defined,
-  we give precedence to site_encoding and then fallback to utf-8.
-  Bonus: there's no more need to mess with 'sys.getdefaultencoding()'
-  to make tests run... ;-)
-  [deo]
-
-* The subobject Wrapper class is now based on Acquisition.Explicit. And
-  BaseObject's subobject works now.
-  [panjunyong]
-
-* Applied ApeSupport changes needed for APE 1.0. Thanks to Roch?ompaan.
-  Changed comment to doc-string.
-  [yenzenz, zwork]
-
-* Added Italian translation. Thanks to Mirto Silvio Busico.
-  [deo]
-
-* Change permission of OrderedBaseFolder's manage_renameObject to make
-  FTP works.
-  [panjunyong]
-
-* Fixedi [ 1053960 ] Cancel goes back to previous schemata page, thanks
-  to Alec Mitchell.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Fix redirect of ZMI constructor, fix ZMI base_add and base_edit.
-  [__gotcha]
-
-* Fixed [ 1058669 ] Wrong i18n:translate in widgets/field.pt.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Use method getFilename in at_download.pt instead of direct attribute access,
-  which ignores BaseUnit.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Fixed [ 1084278 ] In www/generateDebug.zpt error in *
-  getTypeInfo(type['name']).
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Applied patch in [ 1076864 ] schemata links need css declaration, thanks to
-  David Convent.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Fixed [ 1067923 ] Field.py: ImageField.get_size does not work properly.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Fixed bugs in the reference graph feature that was broken for me.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Fixed [ 1066884 ] Field.py: getAvailableSizes 1.3.1-rc4. Thanks to Steve
-  McMahon.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Fixed path to kernel uuid pseudo file.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Don't use the format selector from wysiwyg.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed __pkginfo__.py: use version.txt instead of coping a string to
-  several places; changed license to the current license "BSD-like".
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Fixed reference cataloging when dealing with BTree folders.
-  [brcwhit]
-
-* Fixed [ 948385 ] Allow wysiwyg editors to override RichWidget format
-  pulldown.
-  [duncanb, ender]
-
-* Fixed traversal/WebDAV for the nth time, now with tests.
-  [dreamcatcher]
-
-* Fixed a possible problem when installing uid_catalog.
-  [zopezen]
-
-* Added multi-field support to getFilename/setFilename and also
-  getContentType/setContentType. Bonus: reformated ChangeLog... ;-)
-  [deo]
-
-* Updated Catalan translation. Thanks to Albert Lombarte.
-  [deo]
-
-1.3.1-final - 2004-11-15
-------------------------
-
-* Some visual fixes to RichWidget and Field code + removed stray comments.
-  [limi]
-
-* Fixed field tests.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-1.3.1-rc4 - 2004-11-06
-----------------------
-
-* reverted the patch from duncan because of too many bugs :(
-  final decicion for 1.3.x: we keep the 1.3.0-final reference copy
-  behaviour.
-  [hazmat, geoffd, yenzenz]
-
-* fixed reference_slot, wasnt adapted to the new style reference engine.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-1.3.1-rc3 - 2004-11-05
-----------------------
-
-* There where lots of discussions about the behaviour of references while
-  copying. it ends up in 1.3.0-final with the default behaviour to do not
-  copy references if a object is copied. now this is for several use-cases
-  a great problem, and it's also difficult to copy them afterwards.
-  finally we decided to make it configureable per reference in 1.4.x. A
-  solution for 1.3 is provided by the patch from duncan booth we applied
-  here. its transparent to the 1.3.0-final behaviour. you now can set
-  in archetypes tool the copying behaviour. it defaults to not copy
-  references.
-  [duncanb, yenzenz]
-
-* Changed boolean widget so that the checkbox is displayed before
-  the label and not below the help text. Makes more sense UI wise.
-  [_ender_]
-
-* Fix manage_delObjects of BaseFolderMixin that did not return anything.
-  [__gotcha]
-
-* Allow comma as dezimal delimiter in FixedPointField and convert it
-  immediatly to a point-delimited-value. The whole process needs a rewrite
-  in 1.4, this here is only a quick non-immersive usability enhancement.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-1.3.1-rc1 - 2004-10-17
-----------------------
-
-* Fixed [ 1037265 ] Bug in ArchetypeTool:getWidgets(). Thanks to Tommy from
-  IBAS for the catch.
-  [deo]
-
-* Fixed a bug with TemplateMixin on folderish types: in navtree and on view
-  tab the choosen template has been ignored, cause it felt back to an action
-  folderlisting, which now is set to view instead.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Applied patch contributed in [ 1038107 ] Problems with addable_types
-  handling in ReferenceWidget. Thanks to Alec Mitchell for the patch.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-* Added Archetypes Site customization policy.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Changed it so that Title is not shown twice in view mode (once in the headline
-  is fine, thank you ;)
-  [limi]
-
-* Fixed [ 1042076 ] missing import in SQLMethod.py: atoi and time were missing.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1043114 ] WEBDAV folder creation broken.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Updated quickref. Thanks to Jean Jordaan for his great work!
-  [neaj, tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1037803 ] "AT Document Details" should be "Document Details" in edit
-  Now Archetypes is using the portal type name by default instead of the
-  archetype_name. You can change the new behavior by using a different
-  type_name var in the templates.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added some ugly hacks to ship around [ 1040623 ] FTP upload broken. You may
-  say it's fixed for AT 1.3 but for AT 1.4 we will have a much better
-  implementation.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1038404 ] BaseFolder.mange_delObjects proteced by wrong permission.
-  Now the method is protected by CMFCorePermissions.DeleteObjects instead of
-  CMFCorePermissions.ModifyPortalContent which is exactly like Plone 2.x.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1038428 ] Unicode string in Subjects break base_metadata page.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Partly fixed [ 1038450 ] Unauthorized due to BaseObject.__bobo_traverse__.
-  Now __bobo_traverse__ is raising an AttributeError instead of returning None
-  when the object can't be traversed.
-  [dmauerer, tiran]
-
-* Added workaround for [ 1040514 ] AttributeError on some types after migration
-  1.2.4rc5->1.3.0 to BaseUnit. Somehow and sometimes the binary attribute gets
-  lost magically.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Extensions/utils.py (install_additional_templates): Added a method to
-  automagically register classes that inherit from TemplateMixin.
-  [deo]
-
-* Added Catalan translation file. Thanks to Albert Lombarte.
-  [deo]
-
-* Added viewableFields() and editableFields() to Schema. The methods are
-  returning only those fields that the current user is allowed to see/edit in
-  the current context.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Archetypes edit form is raising unauthorized if no editable fields are
-  available.
-  [tiran]
-
-* BaseContent.PUT and BaseUnit.PUT is also trying to get the uploaded data from
-  BODY if BODYFILE is empty.
-  [tiran]
-
-1.3.0 - 2004-09-30
-------------------
-
-* Fixed [ 1034649 ] Typo breaks catalog index creation: index_acessor ->
-  index_accessori.
-  [ronnix]
-
-1.3.0-rc4 - 2004-09-25
-----------------------
-
-* Fixed [ 1032587 ] Error in field.Vocabulary. Thanks to Danny Bloemendaal
-  for the catch.
-  [deo]
-
-* Disabled two unit tests in test_marshaller because they were causing a memory
-  fault in glibc. It's probably the cause of either wvWare or the test doc
-  file.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added transaction_note to PloneCompat and use it instead of the one from
-  Plone to keep backward comp. with CMF as requested on the mailing list.
-  [tiran]
-
-1.3.0-rc3 - 2004-09-18
-----------------------
-
-* Fixed misc unit tests that where broken or relied on a broken behavior.
-  [dreamcatcher]
-
-* Merged patch from [ 1026732 ] base_metadata can not use 'add $type' reference
-  button.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1029648 ] getBestIcon needs to be better.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Partly fixed [ 1024966 ] Reference migration problem: 1.3a2 --> 1.3rc2.
-  References without a relationship name will get the relationship name
-  EMPTY_RELATIONSHIP which is 'related' by default. That should be fine for all
-  people.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added 'swallowResizeExceptions' attribute to ImageField. When the property is
-  set to True all exceptions raised by PIL are captured and the specified scale
-  isn't created.
-  Note: Some scales might be created when PIL fails only for some sizes.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Field.ReferenceField: Simplify code a bit. Fix a typo on exception name.
-  [dreamcatcher]
-
-* Fixed [ 1023153 ] isEmpty validator must return empty string by using the new
-  isEmptyNoError validator.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1029231 ] base_metadata doesn't use JS scripts properly, also cleaned
-  up the base_metadata and added support for helper CSS.
-  [tiran, kai]
-
-* Fixed [ 1025842 ] Missing i18n:translate in widgets/field.pt <label>
-  [tiran]
-
-* Cleaned up and fixed ExtensibleMetadata class:
-  no more direct attribute access or attribute storage, rearranged some lines,
-  use 'date is None and fallback or date' because testing for is None is,
-  much faster than testing a DateTime instance for not None.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added SQL* and VariableSchemaSupport to public.py. Please import only from
-  public!
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added class and id attributes to fields rendered in view-mode (field.pt).
-  These had been accidentally left out.
-  [elvix]
-
-* Fixed problem with BaseBTreeFolder losing references. It was calling
-  CMFBTreeFolder manage_* methods which would end calling
-  PortalFolder.manage_* methods (as they are not overriden in the class
-  hierarchy) twice. The second type it would remove the references as
-  there's a monkeypatch on Archetypes/patches.py which sets _v_cp_refs to
-  None when calling CMFCatalogAware.manage_beforeDelete.
-  [dreamcatcher]
-
-* Fixed copy problem with AggregatedStorage by added __getstate__ and
-  __setstate__ methods. Before the chances copy.deepcopy was trying
-  to copy a thread lock.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Finally removed markCreationFlag which was a bad hack to achieve the same
-  effect as portal_factory but w/o using portal_factory. I had a problem with
-  it again and I don't want to have more headache!
-  [tiran]
-
-* Changed BaseObject.initializeArchetype() to call edit() instead of update().
-  edit() is an alias for update and it's also the standard method to edit a
-  type in CMF. It makes customization like in ATContentTypes much easier.
-  [tiran]
-
-1.3.0-rc2 - 2004-09-04
-----------------------
-
-* Removed class="error" from field.pt error message. It caused some ui
-  glitches.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1011658 ] portal_skins/archetypes folder disappeared after AT
-  reinstall. Under some circumstances the skins aren't properly registered.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1011533 ] AT CEILING date for expires will break DateIndex. Changed
-  CEILING_DATE from year 9999 to year 2500.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1012238 ] Cannot set field using boolean widget under IE.
-  [duncanb]
-
-* Changed TemplateMixin.getDefaultLayout(): It first checks for an attribute
-  'default_view' then for 'immediate_view' from the FTI and at last it's using
-  'base_view' as fallback.
-  [runyan, tiran]
-
-* Removed warning when trying to apply an index on a reference field from
-  install_indexes. Indexes on reference fields are fully supported again.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Changed permission of BaseObject.getField() and getWrappedField() from
-  ModifyPortalContent to View. All mutators on fields are secured and it won't
-  make any harm to get a field. Besides it is currently possible getting a
-  field over archetype_tool.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1012344 ] 'NoneType' not callable error on CMFMember prefs page. Also
-  cleaned up the way how the value is calculated inside field.pt. Depending
-  on widget.populate it's either assigning edit_accessor or accessor to a var
-  and THEN it's calling the var (which is a method) when it's not None.
-  Sounds complex? Well the former version was much complexer.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Subclasses TemplateMixin from ExtensionClass.Base, set default_view to None
-  in order to enable the immediate_view magic and made the getDefaultView()
-  method a little bit more efficient.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added a test for unqualified references to Schema to prevent user errors. A
-  relationship must be a non empty string. Also moved all field tests in Schema
-  to a new method _validateOnAdd().
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added Danish translation. Thanks to stonor!
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added 'de-de' as fallback to the German translation.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Applied fix from [ 924832 ] Widget:isVisible always returns 'visible' for not
-  DictType which is fixing a broken behavior for Widget.isVisible().
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1012570 ] Widget.py ReferenceField is horribly inefficient.
-  [runyan]
-
-* Temporary fix for [ 1012408 ] __getitem__ doesn't play nice which is backward
-  compatible except of three broken behaviors:
-  BaseObject.__getitem__ now throws an Unauthorized exception when trying to
-  get an item starting with _ and it throws a KeyError when trying to access
-  a nonexisting object. Also it's using explicit acquisition.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed unicodeTestIn.py: return False immediately when the list is None or empty.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Widget.py: Changed some field.get(instance) calls to
-  field.getEditAccessor(instance)() to get rid of some sort of infinite loop
-  (in append_only code forTextAreaWidget).
-  [rafrombrc]
-
-* Readded Extensions/utils.py:install_tools for backward compat.
-  [dreamcatcher]
-
-* fixed edit view rendering of append_only textarea history in
-  widgets/textarea.pt data so whitespace is correct.
-  [rafrombrc]
-
-* Fix a misbehavior on __bobo_traverse__ now that Tiran changed the __getitem__
-  behavior. Before that, __getitem__ was taking precedence and acquiring the
-  object itself, so never getting this far:
-  Nothing has been found. Though it's not written anywere, from deep ZPublisher
-  inspection it seems like we *SHOULD NOT* raise a notFoundError, but instead,
-  return None and leave acquisition do it's job.
-  [dreamcatcher]
-
-* Fixed [ 1011111 ] mishandling of UID W.R.T layers.
-  The reference engine is now using _getCopy() mark the copy of an object with
-  a marker _v_is_cp so manage_afterAdd() can detect copies in order to reassign
-  a new UUID and remove the reference annotations.
-  [bcsaller, rochael]
-
-* Fixed Alan's fix for [ 1012570 ] brains has no relative_url.
-  (note to myself: addable option on ReferenceField still needs lots of tests)
-  [deo]
-
-* Fixed [ 1013265 ] last changes to Widget.py is highly inefficient.
-  [deo]
-
-* Fixed LinesWidget according to [ 1013379 ] LinesField/widget broken.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed bug in VariableSchemaSupport.VarClassGen mentioned in the thread on the
-  AT devel mailing list. See "Warning: avoid changing your AT class' meta_type
-  when you have existing instances".
-  [mitchel, dreamcatcher, tiran]
-
-* Corrected icon in ZMI; Added some utils for ZMI setup.
-  [__gotcha]
-
-* Changed unit test to work with an unpatched version of getToolByName to get
-  mimetyptes_registry and portal_transform.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1015956 ] getBestIcon can fail.
-  [ctheuni]
-
-* Fixed [ 1015292 ] boolean widget error, [ 1015394 ] 1.3 branch field.pt sets
-  value = None inappropriately and another problem with field.pt value.

-* Fixed [ 1018821 ] _processInput in Field.py should rewind.
-  [batlogg]
-
-* Part fix [ 1013363 ] (renaming of folders nukes all references to AT
-  objects inside them):
-  It works now for AT folders, but renaming of non-AT folders stil breaks refs
-  to their contained items so ATContentTypes based portals should be fine now
-  (except you rename the portal itself).
-  [zworkb]
-
-* Added monkey patch for CMFCatalogAware, PortalContent and PortalFolder to
-  fix the second part of [ 1013363 ].
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1019803 ] Bug in ArchetypeTool.py: getWidgets(), also renamed
-  _is_fake_instance to _at_is_fake_instance.
-  [johtha, tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1018300 ] schema defined indexes are not set anymore.
-  [deo]
-
-* Added targetId index to reference_catalog. It was removed earlier to make
-  the ref catalog more lightweight. However, it broke
-  ReferenceCatalog._queryFor.
-  [dpunktnpunkt]
-
-* Explictly reinstall MimetypesRegistry, PortalTransforms and Archetypes when
-  running the migration. Before MTR and PT weren't reinstalled ever and AT
-  under some circumstances which were leading to annoying bug reports.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added StdoutStringIO to migration.py which is printing the input to stdout,
-  too. Also added some gimmicks to the migration: After 10 items a '.' is
-  printed to stdout and after 250 items a '*' is printed to stdout so you can
-  see how the migration is coming along.
-  [tiran]
-
-1.3.0-rc1 - 2004-08-16
-----------------------
-
-* Try to use BaseUnit for schema migration to keep the mimetype and the
-  filename of a BaseUnit based field. Without the changes the mimetype of
-  TextField got lost.
-  This should fix [ 1001446 ] Content type lost in migration from pre 1.3b4 to
-  1.3b4
-  [tiran]
-
-* Changed portal type of ComplexType to keep it compatible with AT 1.2
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed typo in Field.Field.getContentType
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed Field.ImageField.rescaleOriginal to always return a binary string. This
-  fixes the problem with original_size: [ 1004323 ] "IOError: cannot identify
-  image file" when uploading image
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1004510 ] folderlisting or plone_utils.browserDefault by adding an action
-  'folderlisting' to folderish content types.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Use True and False in favor to 1 and 0 to make the code more readable.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Raise an error when trying to use an index on a reference field unless we
-  have a good solution to avoid catalog corruption.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Use edit accessor instead of the accessor in Schema.BasicSchema.validate().
-  [alecacct]
-
-* Added a index_method property to Field.Field which may be either _at_accessor,
-  _at_edit_accessor or the name of a method which is used as accessor for the
-  index.
-  [alecacct]
-
-* Starting from NOW all attributes starting with '_at_' are reserved for
-  internal usage. You MUST NEITHER add NOR access any attributes starting
-  with '_at_' in your content types.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed  FTP/WebDAV's PUT in BaseObject:If a new object should be created with
-  an id that can be acquired, then the existing object is silently overwritten
-  rather than a new one created
-  [dm]
-
-* Fixed with problem MKCOL/MKD used by FTP/WebDAV and
-  BaseFolde.manage_addFolder. Now MKCOL/MKD are creating a sub folder with the
-  type name of the current folder except when this behavior is overwritten
-  by an attribute called _at_type_subfolder.
-  [dm]
-
-* Fixed [ 1006559 ] addReference allows adding garbage references. addReference
-  is raising a ReferenceException when an invalid source or target was applied.
-  [duncanb, tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1006491 ] File widget makes useless str(value) conversion
-  [tiran, lurker]
-
-* Fixed possible issue inside ArchetypeTool.getWidgets() by calling
-  initializeArchetype() on the wrapped dummy instance.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Update catalog on reference catalog has raised a KeyError when trying to
-  access an object that was already removed. Now ReferenceResolver is fetching
-  the KeyError in resolve_url() and returns None instead.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added getRaw() method to LinesField which is returning the output of get().
-  Before this change the edit accessor was using the accessor which might be an
-  overwritten accessor. Thanks to Joel Burton who has figured out the problem.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Raise an ReferenceException inside Field.ReferenceField._Vocabulary when the
-  brain doesn't have a valid uid.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Refresh the uid catalog and reference catalog after migration.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Don't commit full transactions inside migration. This may lead to database
-  corruption.
-  [tiran]
-
-* General cleanup of imports and public.py. Also include Marshallers in public.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1007850 ] Cancel content creation fails with portal factory tool
-  Archetypes is playing nice again with portal factory
-  [tiran]
-
-* Raise SchemaException when trying to add two or more primary fields to one
-  content type. Adding more than one primary field can lead to unexpected
-  behaviors.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Don't store mimetype item instances in BaseUnit. Now BaseUnit is storing the
-  mimetype and the binary flag as ordinary strings. Old BaseUnits are auto-
-  magically altered using __setstate__().
-  Storing mimetype item objects in BaseUnit seemed to lead to memory leaks.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Reenabled ints as DisplayList and Vocabulary keys.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Subclass InAndOutWidget from ReferenceWidget which adds the addable feature
-  to InAndOutWidget.
-  [ender]
-
-* Removed old and deprecated old_OrderedBaseFolder implementation from
-  Archetypes.
-  [tiran]
-
-* There is no need to subclass BaseFolder from Folder since SkinnedFolder is
-  already subclasses from Folder (over PortalFolder).
-  [tiran]
-
-* Store subobjects inside a volatile attribute instead of using SESSION which
-  1) was broken by design 2) was a possible memory eater.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 988948 ] Reference field: radio button "no reference" isn't checked
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added properties for [ 1008670 ] Feature request: specify year interval for
-  the Calendar Widget
-  Right now these properties are useless because the plone templates can't
-  handle it but I got word from limi that we are allowed to add these features
-  to the templates
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1005843 ] Stringfields should not default to '0' in search mode
-  [tiran]
-
-* Moved addable feature of reference.pt to a seperate file and added addable to
-  inandout.pt
-  [ender]
-
-* Use manage_rebuildCatalog for refresh_references in installTypes()
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 905677 ] manage_afterClone is a bit of a mess
-  [dreamcatcher]
-
-* Template cleanups
-  [dreamcatcher]
-
-* ImageField: Fixed problem with empty image field and calls to getScale,
-  getSize and tag()
-  [tiran]
-
-* Cleaned up the Extensions/utils.py function which are installing AT and it's
-  dependencies. Added a method setupArchetypes() which is setting up the internals.
-  These fixes are fixing the problem that AT don't seemed to be installed when
-  it's installed from an AT based product.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Schema: fixed a bug, it wasnt allowed to override a primary field by another
-  primary field with the same name.
-  [jensens]
-
-* Added getWrappedField(key) to BaseObject which is returning the field
-  instance explictly wrapped relative to the Archetype instance. This method is
-  required for security reasons in order to allow Zope to find the acl_users.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1009894 ] CSS class on validation error messages. It's using Plone's
-  'error' class.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed two bugs in ttw template registration. 1st the registration-tab was
-  broken, and 2cd it can't deal with migrated ATCT.
-  [jensens]
-
-1.30beta5 - 2004-08-06
-----------------------
-
-* Fixed forbidden access to schema methods when the schema was
-  acccessed using archetype_tool.lookupType().
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed typo in widgets/reference.pt
-  [tiran]
-
-* Do not depend on plone's document_byline template which is
-  not available in CMF.
-  [ajung, tiran]
-
-* Applied patch from [ 997044 ] db_encoding parameter is lost
-  in BaseSQLStorage.set
-  [biza, tiran]
-
-* Updated complex type to make it work inside Plone again. It's very
-  usefull to test fields and widgets.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Applied [ 974846 ] Patch for bug #944343 inandout/picklist values
-  not sticky to make picklist and inandout compatible with reference
-  field again.
-  [alecacct, tiran]
-
-* Reenabled Ben's reference graph tool by removing some stalled testing code
-  [tiran]
-
-* Support unqualified references in reference graph tool
-  [bcsaller]
-
-* Added a test for mimetypes registry before adapter call in BaseUnit.update()
-  with a more verbose error in the case the user hasn't updated MTR properly.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed Find Objects of uid catalog and reference catalog: Use the relative
-  path (relative to the portal) of the object as uid instead of the full
-  physical path
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added Rebuild Catalog tab to uid catalog and reference catalog to make the
-  life easier
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added context to the PortalTransform.convertTo() call in BaseUnit.transform()
-  [tiran]
-
-* Don't fail to install a product which doesn't have any types
-  [spamsch]
-
-* Catch Unauthorized exception in ExtensibleMetadata.allowDiscussion that could
-  be raised by the discussion tool when the authenticated users hasn't
-  ModifyPortalContent permissions.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added IUIDCatalog and IReferenceCatalog interface. Test for interfaces in
-  the installation process of Archetypes to remove invalid catalogs.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added a check to Field._Vocabulary: A result from portal catalog must be a
-  result from uid catalog, too.
-  [ender]
-
-* FileField/ImageField: Make sure we always get a wrapped object in content_class
-  [tiran]
-
-* ImageField: Fixed getScale/getSize methods, added tag() method
-  [tiran]
-
-* session_save_form was using direct attr access in UT
-  code you must use Schema accessor so schema has a
-  security context
-  REMEMBER: <BradB> "Free as in Free Iraq"
-  [runyaga]
-
-* issue a warning if they register 2 classes with the
-  same name in the same project.  this will happen on
-  startup.
-  [runyaga]
-
-* do not assume templates have title_or_id attribute
-  [runyaga]
-
-* Added kernel_make_uuid which is using /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuids as source
-  for unique ids. Thanks to Ben for this cool idea. :)
-  The kernel uuid generator is actually a tiny bit slower than our uuid
-  generator but it should be safer if you are worried about the uniqueness of
-  uuids.
-  [bcsaller, tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 1002481 ] Missing i18n: <any>, added at_search_any msgid.
-  [tiran]
-
-1.3.0-beta4 - 2004-07-09
-------------------------
-
-* Fix bug on image deletion [clebeaupin]
-
-* Fixed [ 997899 ] 1.3b3 will ot startup on Zope 2.7, Windows.
-  Removed api helper to avoid problem with windows [dreamcatcher, tiran]
-
-* Small improvements on migration (using aq_base() instead of attribute, using
-  is None test instead of simple bool test)
-  [tiran]
-
-* Get the first non None object instead of the first element of a list of
-  brains to circumvent problems with stalled objects inside the uid catalog
-  [tiran]
-
-* Don't raise AttributeError when no reference can be found
-  [__gotcha]
-
-* Fixed a problem introduced by getRaw method on ReferenceField class.
-  When using a field on 'hidden' mode, field.pt uses field.edit_acessor
-  to get field value (and edit_accessor calls getRaw).
-  The problem was related to ReferenceFields not multivalued where
-  getRaw always returns a list, instead of the single UID.
-  [deo]
-
-* Added a flag refresh_references to Archetypes.Extensions.utils.installTypes
-  (default False). When enabled it's using ZopeFindAndApply to find all
-  objects of the given types and refreshes their references. This is a
-  workaround but not a real fix for bug 997840.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added a test for at_version information
-  [tiran]
-
-* Support Pdata (possible large data from OFS.Image) as type for FileField.
-  This is required to load large images and files based on OFS.Image into a
-  FileField.
-  [tiran]
-
-* Merged sid's security branch. DefaultLayer based classes (Field, Widget) and
-  schema are now subclassed from ExtensionsClass.Base.
-  [dreamcatcher, tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 994511 ] Field.py: Vocabulary cannot handle 2-tuple list
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed creation_date field to be metadata again
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 944440 ] getMsgID method of DisplayList should be used
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 972091 ] base widget doesn't support visble attribute for view
-  [tiran]
-
-* Added better traceback information to fixAfterRenameType
-  [tiran]
-
-* Fixed [ 988898 ] Don't swallow ConflictError (SQL missing)
-  [tiran]
