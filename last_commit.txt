+Changelog
+=========
+
+1.0.13 (Unreleased)
+-------------------
+
+New:
+
+- Translations moved to plone.app.locales in plone domain.
+  [staeff]
+
+
+1.0.12 (2015-12-01)
+-------------------
+
+- Remove unnecessary test setup.
+  [timo] 
+
+- Fix HTML entities in browse button title
+  [gaudenz]
+
+- Implement __len__ for PathSource
+  [gaudenz]
+
+- Add missing test dependency declaration.
+  [MatthewWilkes]
+
+
+1.0.11 (2015-02-09)
+-------------------
+
+- Add support for providing defaults to contenttrees. This wasn't reliable
+  previously as only defaults that were found by the initial query were
+  rendered. Now SourceBinders take an optional default or defaultFactory
+  argument, in the same format as schema.Choice.
+  [MatthewWilkes]
+
+1.0.10 (2015-01-16)
+-------------------
+
+- Render CSS as link, no css-import. This allows cooking with other
+  link rendered css and gives better asynchronous download behavior.
+  [thet]
+
+- Add support for navigating into objects with spaces in their ids
+  [MatthewWilkes]
+
+1.0.9 (2014-10-25)
+------------------
+
+* Implement ``renderForValue`` on ``ContentTreeBase`` in order to make
+  single valued relation fields work.
+  [rnixx]
+
+1.0.8 (2014-10-21)
+------------------
+
+* Work around bizarro Diazo encoding bug
+  [gyst]
+
+1.0.7 (2013-06-30)
+------------------
+
+* Add in some default binder instances, mostly for use with supermodel XML
+  schemas.
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Switch to ``plone.app.testing``
+  [saily]
+
+* Add js and css registration tests
+  [saily]
+
+* Added check in tree generation if it allready exists (reopening the contenttree window).
+  [phgross]
+
+* Do not exclude content types which are not allowed in navigation [ebrehault]
+
+* Ignore missing values, content objects can go away or the content of a source may change.
+  [gaudenz]
+
+1.0.6 (2012-09-28)
+------------------
+
+* Tweak CSS to use outline instead of border.
+  [elro]
+
+* Avoid theming ajax response.
+  [elro]
+
+* Ensure context is a content item of some sort.
+  [elro]
+
+* Import getSite from zope.component to avoid dependency on zope.app.component.
+  [hvelarde]
+
+* Import ViewPageTemplateFile from zope.browserpage to avoid dependency on
+  zope.app.pagetemplate.
+  [hvelarde]
+
+* Added french translation.
+  [phgross]
+
+* Trigger change handler when used with datagrid
+  [kingel]
+
+* Use an ajax fetch for the initial call
+  [kingel]
+
+* Fix url in display templates, so that it uses absolute urls.
+  [phgross]
+
+* pep8
+  [joka]
+
+* Fix term title genration to use the brain id if there is not brain title
+  [joka]
+
+* Added Italian translation.
+  [gborelli]
+
+* Added Finnish (fi) translation.
+  [dokai]
+
+* By default filter out nodes that are not selectable and not folderish.
+  This can be overridden on the widget by setting show_all_nodes to True.
+  [maurits]
+
+* Added Dutch translation.
+  [maurits]
+
+1.0.5 (2012-02-20)
+------------------
+
+* Added Spanish translation
+  [hvelarde]
+
+1.0.4 (2011-10-04)
+------------------
+
+* fix _getBrainByValue to check if value is traversable
+  first so we can provide the correct token.
+  [vangheem]
+
+1.0.3 (2011-09-24)
+------------------
+
+* Add zh_CN translation.
+  [jianaijun]
+
+1.0.2 (2011-07-02)
+------------------
+
+* Fix regression that broke the browsing with JQuery < 1.4.
+  [davisagli]
+
+1.0.1 (2011-05-16)
+------------------
+
+* Make placeholder terms for hidden / missing items, so that you can still see
+  something in the editing interface and not accidentally remove them. Ideally
+  we should say if a page is invisible or missing, but not today.
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Use javascript function from plone.formwidget.autocomplete to add new input
+  boxes, make javascript as clone-safe (when making new rows in datagridfield)
+  as possible
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Just use full widget name in ++widget++ URL, don't try and strip form prefix
+  off. If within a subform, this is the wrong thing to do and the traverser now
+  supports stripping the initial 'form.widgets'
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Workaround for sources being used without being bound first.
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Check the request for context before falling back to getSite()
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Add a UUIDSource that stores plone.uuid pointers to content.
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Use tokens as full URL of content, move all token<->value operations into the
+  source. Rename methods so that actually-public methods have public names
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Alter terms so that token is the full path to an item, value is the path
+  without portal_url that is stored in the DB. This means all the path parsing
+  can be kept within the source.
+  [lentinj]
+
+* _filter is used outside the source, so not an internal helper function
+  anymore.
+  [lentinj]
+
+1.0 (2011-04-30)
+----------------
+
+* Made compatible with Plone 4.1 by loading the permissions.zcml from
+  Products.CMFCore (only when plone.app.upgrade is available, to keep
+  compatibility with Plone 3, if we currently have that).
+  [maurits]
+
+* Improved CSS for selected items to make them more evident in the Sunburst
+  theme.
+  [davisagli]
+
+* Add content type CSS class to items in the navtree so that icons are shown
+  in Plone 4.
+  [davisagli]
+
+1.0b3 (2011-02-11)
+------------------
+
+* Use `zope.i18n.translate` instead of translation_service, since
+  translation_service was removed in plone4.
+  [jbaumann]
+
+
+1.0b2 (2010-08-25)
+------------------
+
+* Fall back to the site to perform content-related operations if the
+  context is not wrapped into an acquisition chain.
+  [dukebody]
+
+* Compute the view name as the request URL left-stripped the content
+  absolute URL.
+  [dukebody]
+
+* Make it possible to restrict the field to objects below a path
+  The constructor of ObjPathSource takes a path keyword argument
+  with a PathIndex catalog query. This argument filters objects
+  outside of this path. If the navigation_tree_query does not have
+  a path argument, the path is also copied into this query.
+  [gaudenzius]
+
+* Update widget in the contenttree-fetch browser view
+  The widget.update() call rebinds to source which previously
+  was only bound during traversal. This avoids problems with
+  sources that only work after security is applied.
+  [gaudenzius]
+
+1.0b1 - 2010-04-19
+------------------
+
+* Adjusted styles so the widget looks reasonable with Plone 4's sunburst theme.
+  [davisagli]
+
+* Fix icons in CMF 2.2.  This closes
+  http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=111
+  [davisagli]
+
+* Make the widget work properly on Zope 2.12
+  [optilude]
+
+* Add a template for HIDDEN_MODE.
+  [csenger]
+
+* Convert all strings in a new navtree node into unicode using the site
+  encoding to render non-ascii characters in the widget.
+  [csenger]
+
+* Added message IDs for translations and added locales directory with
+  german translations.
+  [jbaumann]
+
+1.0a5 - 2009-08-02
+------------------
+
+* Don't filter children of non-queriable parent types (e.g. Large Plone
+  Folders).
+  [optilude]
+
+1.0a3 - 2009-07-12
+------------------
+
+* Apply patch from Gerhard Weis to make the lightbox play nicer with CSS
+  z-indexes.
+  [optilude]
+
+1.0a3 - 2009-06-29
+------------------
+
+* Fix security validator to work properly on add views and other views using
+  namespace traversal (++add++...)
+  [optilude]
+
+1.0a2 - 2009-06-28
+------------------
+
+* Fix display widgets.
+  [optilude]
+
+* Import SitemapNavtreeStrategy conditionally so it doesn't break on Plone
+  trunk. [davisagli]
+
+1.0a1 - 2009-04-17
+------------------
+
