+------------------
+

+  Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10754.
+  [esteele]
+

+  error.  Refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9796.
+  [maurits]
+
+- Make sure the atct_album_view calls getText with a full acquisition
+  chain to avoid an AttributeError: kupu_captioned_image, but avoid

+  and http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8190.

+  Which fixed http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10226
+
+- Products.ATContentTypes.content.folder.ATBTreeFolder is now deprecated.
+  Normal ATFolders (as implemented in plone.app.folder) are now suitable for
+  storing large numbers of items in most cases.  If you need a folder that
+  doesn't track order at all, use a normal ATFolder (from plone.app.folder)
+  with the ordering attribute set to u'unordered'.
+  [davisagli]
+
+- Merge fix of test_queryCatalogOverrideCriteria from 1.3.6 branch
+  [toutpt]

+  [limi]
+
+- Updated templates to follow recent markup conventions.
+  References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9981
+  [spliter]
+
+- Fixed the portal type criterion to use the really user friendly types

+  [hannosch]

+
+2.0a3 - 2009-12-03

+  [davisagli]
+
+2.0a2 - 2009-12-02

+  [davisagli]

+  [rossp]
+
+2.0a1 - 2009-11-18
+------------------
+
+- Pass an _initializing_ flag when updating fields on object initialization,
+  to avoid indexing twice (since CMF indexes on the item's ObjectAddedEvent,
+  which now takes place after the call to initializeArchetype).
+  [davisagli]
+
+- Replaced date criterion "ago/from now" by "in the past/in the future".
+  [vincentfretin]
+
+- help_criteria_field_name msgid was used twice but with different default

+  http://dev.plone.org/old/plone/ticket/9186.
+  [erikrose]

+  site manager.
+  [davisagli]

+  [hannosch]

+  into this package.

+
+- Declare package dependencies and fixed deprecation warnings for use
+  of Globals.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Changed parameter name at script getXMLSelectVocab.py from 'method' to

+  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6960.

+  [hannosch]
+

+  [hannosch]
+
+- Moved a manage_renameObject method from the autosort code into the ordered
+  base class. It wasn't quite obvious, but the code was actually used.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Removed icalendar package from the thirdparty folder. We don't use it
+  ourselves and it's easy installable nowadays for anyone who wants it.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Removed never fully implemented autosort and urlupload modules.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Removed the weird Zope2 Interface to zope.interface bridging code.

+1.2.1 - 2007-09-12

+  [wichert]
+
+- Properly i18n-ize imagetransforms TRANSPOSE_MAP by using ATCTMessageFactory.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Removed all usage of PloneMessageFactory and replaced it by using ATCT's own
+  message factory. The extraction tools aren't able to deal with two different
+  message factories used for a single package.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Fixed some i18n markup to use new ids for the collections related messages,
+  so these do not conflict with the old ones using smart folder.

+  Also fix related typo-induced security hole.
+  [optilude]
+
+- Corrected cmf_edit_kws on the new ATDocumentBase class, which is used as a
+  base for ATNewsItem. It's absence caused a test failure in CMFPlone for the

+------------------------
+
+- Adjusted tests to deal with the new default vocabulary for boolean fields.

+  GenericSetup profiles. This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6156.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Set ATFile's file field to be 'searchable'.  This means that it'll
+  be indexed correctly including transforms.  If you don't want this,
+  set your own 'index_method', or set 'searchable' to False in your
+  code.
+  [nouri]
+
+- Extinguished last occurrences of old portal_status_message in URL support.
+  [hannosch]

+  [hannosch]
+
+- Updated installation tests, as ATCT is no longer 'quickinstalled' anymore.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- removed schemata='default' for allowDiscussion field in finalizeATCTSchema.

+  [ender]
+
+- Moved fields of content types into several schemas.
+  [fschulze]
+
+- Removed properties tab, as we now use the all-schemas-on-one-page feature
+  of Archetypes.
+  [fschulze]
+
+- Some general test cleanup in order to make the test output readable.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Removed the view alias of index.html for all standard content types. This
+  makes it possible to create and upload files called index.html to the
+  site, which is quite common when batch importing old sites into the site.
+  As someone might rely on the former behaviour, we do not migrate
+  any existing type information. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4837.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Got rid of last remnants of zLOG. Grep is our friend!
+  [stefan]

+  base profile.
+  [hannosch]

+  [ajung]
+
+- Moved css rules for the photo album view inside Plone's public.css, instead

+
+- Updated thirdparty/icalendar to version iCalendar-0.11. Dropped the

+  [k_vertigo, hannosch]
+
+1.0.6-final - unreleased

+
+- Disabled the possibility to change index and metadata names and descriptions

+  [hannosch]

+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5119
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.0.2-final - 2006-01-03
+------------------------
+
+- Fixed #5028: constraintypes.py doesn't work properly with PortalFactory when
+  acquiring types.
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5028
+  [panjunyong]
+
+- fixed styles for thumbnailview.
+  [spliter]
+
+- content/events.py: made event type look-up respect dynamic types.
+  [raphael]
+
+- Don't return "n/a" in get_size(). This fixes Plone's #5030.
+  [nouri]
+
+- Fixed #5026: Setting a ZCatalog sort limit was interfering with result
+  batching. Only use the sort_limit optimization when batching is disabled.
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5026
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed #4567: Added portal_atct method to fix portal_type on CMF objects that
+  have empty portal_type because they were incorrectly instantiated. Such
+  situations caused migration to fail. This method is available in the type
+  migration form, and also runs automatically on install.
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4567
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed #4937: Removed list criteria from text indices, because it makes no
+  sense, AND and OR must be used explicitly.
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4937
+  [alecm]
+
+- Added migration for #4865 to fix the grammar on existing instances.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Made the criteria to index type mapping a little more sane.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed #4915: Smart Folders with path criteria where throwing errors on
+  unindex due to partial reference support.
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4915
+  [alecm]
+
+- Added And/Or operator to selection criterion.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed #4590: Subfolders inherit the selected layout of their parent folders
+  if they are of the same type.
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4590
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed #4512 - vCal export was not working with outlook.
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4512.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Use the ControlledMarshaller from the Marshall product if
+  available. Fallbacks to existing marshaller.
+  [sidnei]
+
+- Enable __dav_marshall__ by default on ATTopic, ATFolder and
+  ATBTreeFolder.
+  [sidnei]
+
+- Fixed #4572 and #4909 - Unicode problems with using kupu together
+  with mxTidy
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Fixed #4865 - Spelling error on location criteria.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- On invalid mimetypes the getIcon method of ATFile doesn't throw an exception
+  anymore but generates a log entry. This should minimize some migration
+  problems or at least tell the exact object with an invalid mimetype.
+  This should fix http://plone.org/collector/4979.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Correct some wrong security settings.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Code cleanup removing lots of unused import statements.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Fixed two issues with PathCriterion.  It was using depth 0 to get subfolders,
+  the proper parameter is depth -1.  Also, in order to properly handle the
+  references it holds, it must itself be cataloged in the UID catalog, and
+  have its references cataloged.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed issue causing archetypes schema update to fail due to topic not
+  checking syndication state in initializeArchetype.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Added missing alternate views for folderish types.
+  [alecm]
+
+1.0.1-final - 2005-10-13
+------------------------
+
+- Fixes for http://plone.org/collector/4709 __bobo_traverse__ doesn't
+  need or want a RESPONSE argument.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4734 It is generally a bad idea
+  to check permissions in bobo_traverse methods, especially permissions
+  that don't exist, especially if you then try to raise an exception that
+  you haven't actually imported.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fix two small i18n default text inconsistencies
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.0.0-final - 2005-09-05
+------------------------
+
+- Packaged 1.0.0 final with a tip of the hat to Christian Heimes who has
+  disappeared from our radar. We miss you, dude.
+  [stefan]
+
+- Made migration more tolerant of conflicting ids due to auto-created content
+  from manage_afterAdd or similar.  Fixes http://plone.org/collector/4468
+  [alecm]
+
+- Moved the exclude from navigation checkbox back to the properties tab, on
+  folderish objects, per request from limi.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed two Smart folder issues: http://plone.org/collector/4594 we now fail
+  gracefully on bad limit settings, and http://plone.org/collector/4601 added
+  show/hide all link to the medatata control panel.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Changed Subject index/metadata title to Keywords, and added appropriate
+  description.
+  [alecm]
+
+1.0.0-rc5 - 2005-08-18
+----------------------
+
+- Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4429 by updating the modifySelectList.js
+  to deal with IE deficiencies.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Display files inline if they are of mimetype text/- thanks to LaurenceRowe
+  for the patch.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4448 index titles in smart folder's
+  criteria edit form were not translated
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.0.0-rc4 - 2005-08-09
+----------------------
+
+- Implemented the custom PUT_factory in both ATCTOrderedFolder and
+  ATCTBTreeFolder, as inheriting it from ATCTFolderMixin breaks when
+  LinguaPlone comes into play.
+  [stefan]
+
+- Enable syndication on topics by default.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Made inherit criteria field only appear when the parent of a Smart Folder
+  is also a Smart folder.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Added permissions checks to listSubTopics.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Remove Smart Folder syndication action as the action category has changed
+  in CMF.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed bug in subtopic listing.
+  [alecm]
+
+1.0.0-rc3 - 2005-08-01
+----------------------
+
+- Change manage_copyObjects' permission to Copy or move, just copy from
+  Plone's PortalFolder.
+  [panjunyong]
+
+- Added method to fix the portal type name of CMF based objects
+  that were imported or copied from an unmigrated site to a migrated
+  site. The fix method is available in the type migration tab.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added code to remove deprecated external methods.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed an error in the module alias code for the exif library. Fixes
+  http://plone.org/collector/4352 - Uploading certain images causes ATCT
+  pickling errors
+  [tiran]
+
+- Expose some advanced migration options to the user by using new propertites
+  in the portal_atct tool.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Enhanced and updated documentation, mostly the feature documentations in
+  the portal_atct tool.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Moved migration related code from tool/atct.py to tool/migration.py. The
+  tool class was getting too long.
+  [tiran]
+
+1.0.0-rc2 - 2005-07-28
+----------------------
+
+- Updated requirements to CMFDynamicViewFTI 1.0.0 and ATRefBrowserWidget
+  1.1.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed error in config loader code. The loader must stop after the first
+  conf file is loaded or the conf file is overwritten by the default file.
+  [panjunyong]
+
+- Add optional arguments to ATTopic.queryCatalog to make it compatible with
+  getFolderContents (optional batching, return full objects instead of
+  brains).  Make the album_view compatible with Smart Folders.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Added fix for exif issue when rescaling the original image.  The exif
+  information is now stored before the image is set.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added a main macro to a few templates so they display nicely when used in
+  discussion_reply_form.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Added workaround for broken WebDAV/FTP clients like Mac OS X Finder.
+  PUT_factory is patched to use the default_PUT_factory which creates
+  standard Zope objects instead of CMF/AT content objects.
+  Thx to Nate and ATAudio for the idea.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed http://members.plone.org/collector/4321 which was caused by three
+  distinct bugs. 1) The initial rename of the CMF object didn't preserve
+  order, but rather moved the object to the end of the list.  2) When
+  migrating folders the check for orderability on self.new always failed
+  because self.new is None at this point, so ordering wasn't attempted.
+  3) When going through the subobjects of a folder the position was noted,
+  and then the object deleted, the next object was now in the same position
+  as the prior one and the order was lost.  Now there is a seperate loop to
+  delete the objects after the loop which marks the order and preserves the
+  object.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed some minor issues with the relative url and CMF uid handling in
+  ATFavorite.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added AT and CMF uid migration to the migration system.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed the unit test fixture and ATFavorite unit tests. Now tests aren't
+  running as Manager only when really needed.
+  [tiran]
+
+1.0.0-rc1 - 2005-07-23
+----------------------
+
+- Fixed error in version parsing which somehow made portal_types disappear.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Enabled swallowResizeExceptions by default and added warning that original
+  image resizing destroies the exif information before the data is saved.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed spelling error in a security declaration of ATTopic.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed critical migration issue. Locally added roles and locally changed
+  permissions are now migrated. Also added unit tests to verify the
+  migration.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Cleanup up unit tests and logging to reduce the noise
+  [tiran]
+
+- Removed 'MakerNote JPEGThumbnail' from the exif tags. Some cameras might
+  store the thumbnail in this tag.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Removed unused customization policy including unit test. Plone 2.1 always
+  installing ATCT.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed 4330 Inter-version ATCT migration fails to migrate types
+  to CMFDynamicViewFTI. Migration to the new FTI is part of the version
+  migration again.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added migration step + unit test for '(selected layout)' change.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Optimized getRawRelatedItems index addition. There is no need to reindex
+  the *whole* catalog when adding a *single* index.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Made the 'view' method aliases point to '(selected layout)' instead of
+  '(default view)'. This assures consistency with previous behaviour,
+  so that /view at the end of a URL always gets the item itself, ignoring
+  any default-page that may be set. Note that the 'view' *action* still
+  points to 'string:${object_url}', so that the 'view' tab, as well as
+  the '(Default)' target, still get '(dynamic view)' (and thus default
+  pages) for types other than File and Image.
+  [optilude]
+
+- Added migration/othermigrator.py for other migrators like CMFPhoto and
+  CMFPhotoAlbum. These migrators are written but not yet available to end
+  users. Some glue code needs to be written.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Moved exif library to a new directory thirdparty/. This directory should
+  contain all third party extensions that are required to run ATCT. Well
+  lib/ was added for this purpose the first time. thirdparty/ is added to
+  sys.path at position three which is right after Zope's instance home
+  and zope home in most cases.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Removed lot's of unused imports.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4083 for atct_album_view.pt
+  [ender]
+
+- Fixed
+  http://sf.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=645337&aid=1215755&group_id=55262
+  by making the template sane.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed get_size for ATImage. It should return only the file size of the
+  original image.
+  [tiran]
+
+- HEAD fixes for folder based content types.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed permission issue in formatCatalogMetadata.py.
+  [alecm]
+
+- ConstrainTypes should default to disabled unless the parent object is of
+  the same portal type.
+  [alecm]
+
+- General get_size fixes. The get_size() method returns either the size
+  of the primary field or 1 for folders.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Moved not yet implemented URL upload feature out of the main code.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed constraintypes's allowedContentTypes and invokeFactory to make
+  ENABLED mode work when the portal_type is different with parent's.
+  [panjunyong]
+
+- Added http access functionl http tests.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added HEAD() method to Topic. If the topic has at least one criterion or
+  it can acquire a query 200 OK is return else 404 NotFound
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [Plone] 4295/ 1 Request "ATCT and related items fields".
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added workaround for [ 1229206 ] 2.0.5 > 2.1 migration fails. Failing
+  reorder is mostly harmless.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added workarounds for EXIF MakerNote errors. Some cameras are *really*
+  broken. Better no make notes than no exif infos at all.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed and improved recent changes to cleanupFilename(). You can't remove
+  features w/o keeping backward compatibility and new features must be
+  bullet proof!
+  [tiran]
+
+- Clean up multiple Topic folder_contents tabs.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Readded a seperate _cleanupFilename method for ATCTFileContent to make it
+  better for patch.
+  [panjunyong]
+
+- Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4218 ATCT now uses normalizeString from
+  PloneTool.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4170 Link checking is crazy and [ 1197068 ]
+  [hannosch]
+
+- made constraintypes default ACQUIRE mode works with portal_factory
+  [panjunyong]
+
+- Added Five/Zope3 interface bridges
+  [tiran]
+
+- Disabled text/x-python and text/plain-pre by default. Customize the
+  atcontenttypes.conf if you need them.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Removed relatedItems field from folderish objects.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Made download tab for File and Image invisible.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed __bobo_traverse__ in ATImage, security check was unnecessary and
+  required anonymous to have 'View' in order for anyone to use it.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Yet another migration optimization: Added catalogpatch to the migration
+  system. The patch is altering portal_catalog.catalog_object and
+  uncatalog_object. Read migration/catalogpatch.py for more informations.
+  The catalog patch can be enabled by passing use_catalog_patch=True to
+  the migration functions.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed last bit of http://plone.org/collector/3060  Don't let missing CMF
+  types crash portal_atct.disableCMFTypes().
+  [alecm]
+
+- Enhanced migration code:
+   - CatalogWalkerWithLevel is now based on ExtendedPathIndex
+     and behaves like CatalogWalker.
+   - Added walker arguments for transaction size, full transactions.
+     and savepoints. The migration system can use ZODB savepoints to
+     roll back to a sane point.
+   - Migrators are also registered by (src,dst) meta_type.
+   - The new function migratePortalType() can be used to migrate a single
+     content type by just passing the src and dst portal type to the
+     function. Both portal types must be registerd in portal_types and a
+     migration from src to dst meta_type must exist.
+
+  [tiran]
+
+- Don't catalog all types in _catalogTypesByMetatype it the passed list is
+  empty.
+  [jenner, alecm]
+
+- Modified templates to use the new pretty_title_or_id feature from plone.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Made atct_album_view use the catalog like other listings, and reuse the
+  nice macro from folder_listing.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Zope2.7 compatibility again: replaced import transaction with from
+  Products.CMFPlone import transaction.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Some minor i18n tweaks.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Updated INSTALL.txt for CMF 1.5. Zope 2.8 and more
+  [tiran]
+
+- CMF 1.5 / Zope2.8 compatibility:
+   - replaced CMFCorePermissions with permissions
+   - replaced get_transaction() with transaction
+   - removed product argument from TooolInit()
+   - logging.getLogger() and LOG.debug() etc.
+
+  [tiran]
+
+- Greatly enhanced logging during migration.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Chunked migration in smaller pieces. To be continued!
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed finalize migration so that it doesn't reinitialize the workflow
+  state.  Added unit tests for workflow, local_role, and owner migration.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Using migration code from DynamicViewFTI instead of own FTI migration code
+  [tiran]
+
+- Moved ATCTImageTransform class to lib
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added configuration options for PIL quality and resize algo.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Couple of bug fixes in the FTI->FTI w/ dynamic views migration
+  [rafrombrc]
+
+- Renamed max_size config option to max_file_size. Added max_image_dimension
+  config option to set the maximum border for the original size of an image.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added some additional i18n markup.
+  [hannosch]
+
+Snapshot 2005-07-05
+-------------------
+
+- Don't run version migration when installing the first time. People should run it
+  after type migration.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Disabled full catalog updated after type migration. If people need it they could
+  do it after migration.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added migration to DynamicFTIs.
+  [fschulze]
+
+- Changed index_html method on ATCTOrderedFolder to gracefully handle
+  situation where acquisition of index_html attribute returns None.
+  [rafrombrc]
+
+- Added syndication support to Smart Folders.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixing up aliases and actions for CMF 1.5-style browser-default code, using
+  CMFDynamicViewFTI.
+  [optilude]
+
+- Some code related to browser default is moved to CMFDynamicViewFTI. All
+  new versions of ATCT depend on this product now.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed some tests on Windows. Image files must be opened with 'rb'.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Moved around some fields. excludeFromNav is on the property sheet expect for
+  folderish items and discussion is on the main sheet expecpt for folderish and
+  Favorite.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added finalizeATCTSchema function to move the fields in the right position
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4127 permission incorrect on
+  listSubtopics.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Added migration to change the name of the Topic configlet.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed http://members.plone.org/collector/4076, adding exclude_from_nav to
+  all content schemas.
+  [optilude]
+
+- Fixes for migration of cataloged non-contentish objects.  Now checking
+  meta_type and portal_type before migration steps.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed http://members.plone.org/collector/3804 added validation of filename
+  when appropriate using check_id if available.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Added index for relatedItems, and migration to install it into already
+  installed instances.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Made the tool check if a config entry is available whenever it finds a new
+  index, so that it is automatically enabled if desirable, and to minimize
+  the need for migrations.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Disabled all indexes in criteria form by default, only those with
+  default values are automatically enabled.  This prevents things like ZWiki
+  from messing up our nice edit form.  They can be enabled and prettified in
+  the tool.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Spring i18n cleanup:
+  - changed i18n:domain from plone to atcontenttypes
+  - added missing i18n markup
+  - fixed page templates XHTML errors
+  - reindented and cleaned up whitespaces
+  [deo]
+
+- Made portal_type, selection, and reference criteria return reasonably
+  sorted lists.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Updated folderlisting actions to work properly with optiludes new
+  browserdefault behavior.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Localized date in Topic custom view.
+  [alecm]
+
+1.0-alpha2
+----------
+
+- Disabled history tab.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed a small bug in the exif support. The signatur of the process_file
+  method has changed.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Catch KeyErrors on third party index types in the catalog.  Fix bad import
+  of list criteria.  Fix some unit tests that I broke, and added some more
+  (CriterionRegistry) in penance.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Updated exif lib.
+  [russf]
+
+- Added default values for the index/metadata friendly names, descriptions,
+  and criteria restrictions for Smart Folders using ZConfig.  Added the
+  ability to have an index with no criteria (useful for sort only criteria).
+  Made the descriptions for the criteria types more sensible (I hope this
+  doesn't screw up existing translations, but the current names are terrible).
+  Also, added some missing criteria related strings to manual.pot.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Added a getCriteriaUniqueWidgetAttr method to topics to compile things like
+  'helper_js' in one place for the edit form.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed [ 1196809 ] Use getMutator(self) instead of mutator(self) in base.py.
+  [stefan]
+
+- Added new path criterion for use with ExtendedPathIndex that allows users
+  to select paths to search in using a sitemap.  This now uses the
+  lovely ATReferenceBrowserWidget.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Add Topic to the list of allowed sub-objects for Topic during Migration.
+  It was missing before because the class allowed_content_types property
+  was being overwritten by the one from CMFTopics.
+  [alecm]
+
+- BrowserDefaultMixin.getAvailableLayouts() now returns a list of tuples
+  instead of a DisplayList. Required by interface change in Plone.
+  [optilude]
+
+- Added cool icons for vCal/iCal export and image rotation/flipping made by
+  the legendary Vidar Anderson.
+  [blacktar, tiran]
+
+- Replaced AttributeStorage with AnnotationStorage for Document:text,
+  File:file, Image:image, Event:text and NewsItem:text,image. This requires
+  Archetypes 1.3.5.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added new Current Author criterion which, when used with the Creator index,
+  gets all objects authored by the currently logged in user.  Also fixed some
+  permissions that were preventing normal users from viewing published topics.
+  Fixes issue [ 1176355 ].
+  [alecm]
+
+- Changed processForm to check for id conflicts using check_ids if available,
+  otherwise just `id in parent`. Also commit sub-transaction to make rename
+  work after portal_factory.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Added version migration system mostly copied from plone. Works automatically
+  during Plone 2.1 migration to bring plone 2.0 sites that started with ATCT
+  >= 0.2 up to date including changing and uncatalogging ATTopic criteria and
+  migrating CMF Topics.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed a small bug in Topic migration introduced during the merge.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Made topic.addCriterion() return the newly added criterion object. That
+  it didn't before made things hard for python product developers.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Fixed bug #3773 (http://plone.org/collector/3773) validation check for
+  empty/non-existant files/images.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Changed the behavior of the date criteria to make the meaning of
+  each field clearer.  Now queries like 'More than 2 weeks ago' can be used,
+  and will behave as expected.  This causes some inconsistency in importing
+  CMFTopics.  Queries that were of the form 'min' 'x days' 'ago' are now
+  'less than x days ago' which is a min:max query with an upper limit of now.
+  The same goes for 'max' 'x days' 'ahead', all other queries should be close
+  to identical (modulo an earliestTime() where it makes sense).  The
+  inconsistency shouldn't be too important as the CMF date criteria was
+  entirely inscrutable.  Also changed some strings for criteria descriptions
+  for consistency. Fixes bug [ 1181418 ]. Thanks to Dean Jackson for filing
+  this bug and devising a reasonably usable UI.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Made the portal_types criteria work properly with either Types or
+  portal_types indexes.  Disabled types restrictions in TopicTool, now uses the
+  new Plone 2.1 search blacklist for types (site_properties.unfriendly_types).
+  This creates a plone 2.1 dependency. Also a change was made to the
+  atct_subtopic_form so that it now uses a macro from plone 2.1, this fixes
+  issue [ 1164541 ].
+  [alecm]
+
+- Reworked linked select lists for criteria to use custom XMLHTTPRequest code,
+  contained in modifySelectList.js.  I will eventually turn this into an AT
+  MasterSelectWidget for the master select of two linked select lists.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Added and enabled configlet for Topics, and unit tests for the criteria.
+  Fixed a persistency bug in TopicsTool, and a sort bug the in criteria
+  listing.  Added Missing.MV as a possible false value for Boolean Criterion.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Removed some configuration vars from config.py and the ZConfig schema.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Moved external types from ATCT to the new ATCTAddons product.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Remove path of filename from ATFile's title when upload a file using MS IE.
+  [panjunyong]
+
+- Merged uiteam-plip73-sanitize-short-names from the old plone
+  svn repos: diff http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/ATContentTypes/branches/1.0@6168
+  http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/ATContentTypes/branches/uiteam-plip73-sanitize-short-names
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added flag to determine whether an content object has undergone a successful
+  initial edit.  Use this flag along with detection of default naming to
+  rename object on inital edit.
+  [alecm]
+
+- Merged the topic tool branch into 1.0 XXX: insert history here.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Refactored ConstrainTypesMixin to support PLIP 78:
+
+   - DISABLED means use standard allowed types from portal_types
+   - ENABLED means use restrictions set
+   - ACQUIRE means use types from parent if parent is of same portal type,
+     else same as ENABLED (doesn't make sense to inherit from any content type)
+   - immediatelyAddableTypes field - for subset of allowed types to show in
+     the "add" menu
+   - turned off and removed disable constrain-types flag
+
+  [tiran]
+
+- Turn on TemplateMixin for everything - now directly supported in Plone
+  via "display" menu.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Merged plip #3 branch: auto ordering / sorting into the 1.0 branch.
+  Features / Changes:
+
+   - Added getObjPositioninParent and getObjSize as helper methods for
+     the catalog based folder listing to all types
+   - Added AutoSortSuppot and AutoOrderSupport to ATCT. AutoSortSupport is
+     used for the catalog based folder listing and AutoOrderSupport also
+     adds some auto ordering based on OrderedFolder
+   - Subclass ATFolder from AutoOrderSupport+AutoSortSupport, ATBTreeFolder
+     only from AutoSortSupport
+
+  [tiran]
+
+- ATEvent: Removed end date and start date from searchable text.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Implemented PLIP #2 of ATCT: using ZConfig to configure the types and
+  features of ATContentTypes.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Changed default output of Document, Event and News Item to text/x-safe-html.
+  X-safe-html is using CMFDefault.utils.scrubHTML to remove harmful tags
+  like script.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Merged tiran-notypesdir-branch. It's renaming and moving lot's of modules
+  around. All content types are in the content/ package, criteria were moved
+  to criteria/, tools to tool/ and modules like history aware to lib/. Also
+  all modules and packages were renamed to be lower case.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added history support ATEvent's text field just like Document and News Item.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Updated README.txt and INSTALL.txt: new versions, update from ATCT 0.2 and
+  some other informations.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Changed permission of ATNewsItem.EditableBody() to ModifyPortalContent.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added some tabs to the ZMI view of the portal_atct tool: Overview, rescale
+  migrate and recatalog. The usage of the external methods is deprecated in
+  favor of the tool.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Restored Plone 2.0.x compatibility.
+  [deo]
+
+- Don't show PloneSite, TempFolder and criteria in constrain types list.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Disabled validator for ATEvent's phone field. Some people have reported that
+  they have issues because numbers and especially extensions are handle
+  differently in every country. Also see [ 974102 ] Can't enter phone extension
+  in phone number field.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added XXX report tool to ATCT. It's mostly a copy from the Zope3 XXX tools.
+  Note: XXX is a marker to show "here is something" wrong. It's not porn. :)
+  The tool also reports TODO and BBB (for backward compatibility).
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1049018 ] url field on Link doesn't allow mailto. Also added an
+  isMailto validator to validation and enhanced the isUrl validator to support
+  more protocols.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1114696 ] use correct mimetype for reStructuredText and [ 1122135 ]
+  ATCT edit not preserving text type selection, not ATCT bug be renaming
+  text/restructured to text/x-rst.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1158950 ] ATTopic default view wrong. This fix needs also a svn up
+  of CMFPlone 2.1.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Moved external storage based variants for ATFile and ATImage to a seperate
+  module. They won't make it in the official trunk unless the storage is
+  working well and the types are tested.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added 'atct_album_view' and 'atct_album_image' templates based on the
+  templates of CMFPhotoAlbum.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Replaced the config vars for permissions with new permissions:
+
+   - ModifyConstrainTypes for constrain types mixin
+   - ModifyViewTemplate for template mixin
+   - ViewHistory for history mixin
+   - UploadViaURL for the new upload via url feature
+
+  By default the permissions are restricted to manager only.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added new upload via url feature to upload a file or image using an url. The
+  file is downloaded from the remote server using urllib2. Since this feature
+  isn't finished it's not available by default.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Implemented some very useful functions based on CMFPhoto code for ATImage.
+  The new features are:
+
+   - getting the exif informations from images using Gene Cash's exif lib
+   - getting the image orientation from exif data (rotation and mirror)
+   - Rotating and flipping images using the PIL library incl. a new tab
+
+  [tiran]
+
+  The CMFPhoto exif and transform code was written by several ppl including
+  Oliver Baltzer and me. I'm unable to determine the other coders. Please
+  write me an email if you want credits for your great work!
+  [tiran]
+
+1.0-alpha1
+----------
+
+- Refactored huge parts of the migration suite. More later.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1026616 ] Actions aren't migrated. Actions are migrated from
+  the cmf fti if an action with the id doesn't exist on the atct fti.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Migrating filter content types, allowed content types and allow
+  discussion from cmf fti to atct fti.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Updated requirements to CMFQuickinstaller 1.5/cvs,
+  [tiran]
+
+- Starting to remove the switch* and migrate* external methods.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed default view of ATFolder. Pointing to view again makes a loop and
+  raises a hard to debug exception because TemplateMixin is trying to use
+  itself as default view which doesn't work.
+  [tiran]
+
+- FTests: install kupu and epoz when available. Moved function test suite to
+  ftests/
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1157812 ] ival/vcal action icons not available
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed ATTopic to use atct_edit like all other ATCT types.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added ERRATA.txt which covers known issues.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added integration tests for discussions.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Ported topic migration and criteria enhancements + additional criteria
+  from ender topic branch. Thx to Alec Mitchell for his great work! The new
+  criteria are: ATSelectionCriterion, ATDateRangeCriterion,
+  ATReferenceCriterion and ATBooleanCriterion.
+  [allecm, tiran]
+
+- Changed archetype names of criteria and removed the AT prefix.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added unit tests for criteria and ATTopic.
+  [allecm, tiran]
+
+- Added translate tab when LinguaPlone is available at installation or
+  reinstallation time.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added mini scale with 200x200.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added integration tests for view and edit templates.
+  [tiran]
+
+- I made major changes to the unit test suite. Also I've added more field
+  tests, some important interface tests and cleaner and better base classes
+  for tests.
+  [tiran]
+
+- prepare ATFolder for use with TemplateMixin, use generic /view instead of
+  /folder_listing as default and immediate view.
+  [yenzenz]
+
+- Changed the way ConstrainTypes gets mixed in: Now ATCT is always subclassing
+  folders from the ConstrainTypes class and the schema is always in the folder
+  schema. Before this change ppl couldn't rely on the api. When the feature
+  is disabled the fields are not shown in the schema and the overwritten
+  methods are using a "shortcut" to the default methods.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Renamed some methods in the constrain mixin to start with _ct_ for a clean
+  name space.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added a tag methods to NewsItem for its image. Also changed the caption from
+  TextField to StringField since it should contain only a small sentence or
+  similar. The caption is applied as title to the news item image.
+  [tiran]
+
+- When running unit tests all features like constrain mixin and template
+  mixin are forced to be enabled in order to keep the tests sane and to test
+  all features under all circumstances.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Dismembered the big beast schemata.py in types/ and types/criteria. The
+  schemata are in the same modules as the types.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added content module which contains all important classes.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Replaced all `from foo import *` by explicit imports.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Used some code from Ben's great Bricolite product to have an add permission
+  per type. It allows fine granulated permission settings.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed bug [ 1154073 ] criterion_edit_form.cpt(.metadata) has no default
+  action. The default action for the criterion edit form is save.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added portal_atct tool. The new tool will be used for the new topic features
+  and for the plone control panel.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Interface geddon: Merged all interfaces into a single file.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Merged limi's ui branch which adds a text field to ATEvent and an image plus
+  image caption to ATNewsItem.
+  [limi, tiran]
+
+- Added related items reference field to all types using Danny's reference
+  browser widget. The ATReferenceBrowserWidget has to be available.
+  http://svn.plone.org/archetypes/MoreFieldsAndWidgets/ATReferenceBrowserWidget.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Removed old debian/ directory. I don't maintain it any more so there is no
+  reason of having it in the CVS.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Removed QuotaSupport.py. It should never be in the official tree of ATCT.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Introduced great chances in the migration system: The portal type names of
+  the ATCT types are the same as the CMF types. CMF types will be renamed at
+  install time.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Introduced ZConfig based configuration. It will replace the customconfig.py
+  file.
+  [tiran]
+
+0.2.0-rc5 - 2005-02-26
+----------------------
+
+- Updated requirements to Zope 2.7.4+, Python 2.3.4+ and AT 1.3.2-rc1+.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Cleaned up the migration suite a little bit and enhanced the doc strings.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Replaces the globalAllow hack by createTypeByName which doesn't make
+  security checks like "is the type implicitly or explicitly addable in the
+  folder". It shares the same codebase as the function from PloneUtilities
+  I once wrote to unfuck the create member area method.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Better traceback support inside the migration suite.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added knob to toggle the installation of LinguaPlone in ATCT install.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added explicit portal type name to all ATCT types.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Renamed newTypeFor to _actc_newTypeFor. The former name was confusing
+  people.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added feature to access the name of the last editor through IHistoryAware.
+  [ctheune]
+
+- Fixed a bug in the migration walker. Empty folders aren't skipped any
+  more.
+  [panjunyong]
+
+- Increase debugging in Migration suite to find issues with missing types
+  in globalAllow.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Ported atct_topic_view icon fix from HEAD.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Don't create ATDocuments when uploading .pdf and .doc files.
+  [batlogg]
+
+- Resurrected warning message when we hit a broken object in the folder
+  migration.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Local roles and Creator are kept when migration.
+  [panjunyong]
+
+- Update requirements to the soon to release AT 1.3.2 version and SVN.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added update_data and manage_edit compat. methods to ATFile and ATImage.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added temporary fix for [ 1095242 ] EditableBody in ATNewsItem requires
+  Modify portal content. It will stay in ATNewsItem until Plone is fixed.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1075193 ] infinite recursion in ATEvent. The __cmp__ hook was fixed
+  a while ago but I forgot to mention it here.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1098347 ] validate_add_criterion.vpy has errors. The file was
+  DOS encoded.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Applied patch from [ 1104069 ] ATCT migration -- more ordering issues
+  which fixes some more ordering issues.
+  [hahnfeld]
+
+- atct_topic_view now doesn't call getObject() anymore and is a small
+  bit more performant. This also takes some burden from waking up objects.
+  (Bug 1079030)
+  [ctheune]
+
+- Made HTML the default content type for documents (and news items).
+  [ctheune]
+
+- Fixed [ 1080729 ] Wrong permissions for ATDocument.EditableText /
+  setFormat.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Use StdoutStringIO in migration to be more verbose.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed atct_topcic_view: Make sure there is an object before referencing
+  attributes. This can typically happen if there are problems with the
+  AccessContentsInfo permission.
+  [tesdal]
+
+- Removed support of Python 2.1 and 2.2 from INSTALL.txt. Some code like
+  migration requires new features of Python 2.3 like generators.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added note to INSTALL.txt that ATCT will soon drop support for Zope < 2.7.2.
+  [tiran]
+
+0.2.0-rc4 - 2004-11-30
+----------------------
+
+- ATTopic: Adding the criterion type to the generated id, so you can sort
+  and filter on the same field.
+  [ctheune]
+
+- Fixed unit tests to work without (and hopefully with too) runner again.
+  [ctheune]
+
+- Added feature that doesn't show users non-sortable criterions in the form.
+  [ctheune]
+
+- Added feature that removes double or stupid criterions (allowedRolesAndUsers,
+  id/getId).
+  [ctheune]
+
+- Sorting criterion lists (by their translations).
+  [ctheune]
+
+- Added german translation.
+  [ctheune]
+
+- More i18n support in the templates.
+  [ctheune]
+
+- Fixed _very_ annoying problem with bad ids. this should be bullet proof.
+  [ctheune]
+
+- Extended german translations.
+  [ctheune]
+
+- Fixed ATDocument to not kill uploaded files on the submission of an empty
+  text area.
+  [ctheune]
+
+- Fixed small bug in id protection.
+  [ctheune]
+
+- Fixed the case where the portal doesn't has a 'Members' folder or
+  when it has another name.
+  [deo]
+
+- Fixed [ 1055347 ] id problems when member preferences are set to not
+  display and [ 1055348 ] ATCTFile id problems with portal_factory in
+  ATCTFileContent._setATCTFileContent().
+  [tiran]
+
+- Disabled external storages based types because neither I nor MrTopf have
+  time to support it right now.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added long description field and image tag to ATImage. Fixed [ 1056050 ]
+  Add longdesc to ATImage.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1057691 ] Make ATContentTypes tests works with testrunner.py.
+  Thanks to dan_t.
+  [dan_t, tiran]
+
+- Added fix for [ 1063549 ] ATCT migration doesn't migrate order to
+  migrator.py.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1067719 ] Install.py bug: property modified but not assigned by
+  removing unnecessary code from Install.py. AT itself is already handling
+  use_folder_tabs.
+  [tiran]
+
+0.2.0-rc3 - 2004-10-17
+----------------------
+
+- Added ATContentTypes Site customization policy.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1041830 ] TypeError: cmf_edit() takes at least 3 non-keyword
+  arguments by changing the edit() implementation. A class var named
+  cmf_edit_kws was introduced to fix the issue.
+  [tiran]
+
+- ATLink: Use urlparse library to sanify the url to strip of additional
+  slashes. This is fixing http://plone.org/collector/3296 for ATCT.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added support for the clear format feature of CMF Document.
+  [tiran]
+
+0.2.0-rc2 - 2004-10-06
+----------------------
+
+- Fixed problem with isIDAutoGenerated if the object was not wrapped in
+  a site.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed download tab
+  [tiran]
+
+- Made image/file viewable when invoked directly by adding an index_html.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Replaced tag method of ATImage.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed migration: Migration failed when there was a broken object in a
+  folder.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed property migration: continue if the object already has this
+  attribute.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added talkback discussion migration.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Set description as primary field for ATEvent. Also use an easier syntax
+  for setting description to isMetadata = False.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Renamed tab from history to last changes. Added big warning that the
+  history is based on zodb revisions.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added ExtendingType howto (more to follow).
+  [tiran]
+
+- Recoded migration walkers to use a generator instead returning a list to
+  make them much more memory efficient.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Rewritten folder migration to use the depth inside the folder structur
+  instead of recursing into the full side.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added a findStaledObjects external method to ATCT to find staled objects.
+  It is very useful to clean up a site before running the migration.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed an ugly bug in ATDocument which was screwing up references on copy.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Merged ConstrainTypesMixin from the branch into the HEAD. Thanks to
+  Leonardo Rochael Almeida and Jens Werner Klein for their work.
+  [yenzens, rochael]
+
+- Fixed [ 1013853 ] File upload image shows mime-type in widget.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Removed call to markCreationFlag().
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed problem with ATFavorite: Migration to ATFavorite failed when the
+  object was gone or the user wasn't allowed to access it.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1027070 ] Download permission. Now the download tab is shown for
+  all logged in users with View permission.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1027093 ] Edit permission topics. The edit action of ATTopic now
+  requires ChangeTopic permission.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1027094 ] folderlisting action for ATTopic. Removed folderlisting
+  action using a module level modify_fti function in ATTopic.py.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1026379 ] ATDocument: skipField in setContentType throws error by
+  removing the custom setContentType method. It's not required any more.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Use a copy of the ATContentTypeSchema for every schema to make customizations
+  easier. Fixed [ 1027283 ] Schema editing very hard.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1035380 ] Problems with createMemberArea and ATCT by adding a
+  setFormat() method to ATDocument which is using the translate method to
+  map between stupid CMF content types and real mime types.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Changed mx.Tidy test to work around [ 1033396 ] Error on refresh.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1036267 ] Some typos in customconfig.py.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1036255 ] switchCMF2ATCT: Favorite can't be added anymore. The type
+  was disabled inside the switch script.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1027108 ] Inherit criteria not working.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1030660 ] ConstrainMixin: All types are addable in an ATFolder by
+  using a default_method to initialize the list of addable types. The method
+  _globalAddableTypeIds was added to generate the list.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed a possible problem in allowedContentTypes: Now the method is using
+  fti.isConstructionAllowed(context) to verify that the type is constructable.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added an option called enableConstrainMixin which is a boolean value
+  (checkbox). When set to false the constrain mixin is disabled and the
+  default list of addable types is generated by using the default values
+  from portal_types.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed [ 1030662 ] ConstrainMixin: Can't add an ATTopic to portal root by
+  not subclassing ConstrainTypesMixin for ATCTFolder. ATCTFolder must ONLY
+  to used as a base class for folderish but non folder types.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added max_depth workaround and logging for [ 1039846 ] Ghosts in catalog
+  while migration and endless loop.
+  [tiran]
+
+0.2.0-rc1 - 2004-07-28
+----------------------
+
+- Removed 'contents' tab and 'add new item' menu from ATTopic.
+  [gotcha]
+
+- Changed criteria tab to table UI.
+  [gotcha]
+
+- Added message when clicking remove on criteria without selecting first.
+  [gotcha]
+
+- Depend on new AT 1.3.0-beta3 release.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Changed ZMI add name of topic related types to 'ATContentTypes Topic'.
+  [tiran]
+
+0.2-beta8 - 2004-07-21
+
+- Fixed validation problem with mx tidy validator and file uploads.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Changed time range ints in FriendlyDateCriterion to strings.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Reenable implicitly addable for ATFavorite.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added validation for setup of sort order on topics.
+  [gotcha]
+

+0.2-beta7 - 2004-06-27
+
+- Moved around some code from ATFolder to ATContentType.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed problem with index_html in ATBTreeFolder.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed wrong portal type in Members ATBTreeFolder after migration.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added initializeArchetype() to ATContentType base class and changed it to
+  use edit() instead of update() to make invokeFactory compatible with the old
+  cmf types syntax.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed problem with _getPortalTypeName in initializeArchetype() phase of
+  object creation. Before the fix the portal type name was the original type
+  name (e.g. ATDocument) because it was changed after the initializeArchetype
+  call by the portal types tool. This issue has caused some wired problems with
+  LinguaPlone and workflows.
+  [tiran]
+
+- ATFile file field and ATImage image field are now language independend.
+  Later I will add a I18NImage and I18NFile if needed. Having a seperate type
+  for language dependend content for file and image is in my opinion easier to
+  understand for people. Besides it's like Zope3.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Removed TemplateMixin specific code from ATContentType base class. It was
+  moved to TemplateMixin some time ago.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Better error reporting for migration errors.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed migration problem when LinguaPlone was installed.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added - as valid char for ids.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Reindex only Type, portal_type and meta_type in switching script.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Wrapped field tests in a portal to fix a problem with missing tools.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed migration problem of modified date and created date and also fixed
+  a problem with the unit test that was testing the right date. I was
+  trying to compare the mod date after editing the objects. %-)
+  [tiran]
+
+- Default type of ATDocument and ATNewsItem is configurable in
+  customconfig.py.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Fixed issues with content type registry and registered templates after
+  switching from or to ATCT mode.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added validation to ATEvent: end date must be after start date.
+  [tiran]
+
+- First release with all unit tests of Archetypes, ATCT and CMFPlone
+  tiran-atct-integration branch passing!
+  [tiran]
+
+0.2-beta6 - 2004-06-20
+----------------------
+
+- Added max upload size validator to ATFile and ATImage.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Changed permission for download tab an ATFile. Dont confuse the average
+  user with the green edit frame.
+  [jensens]
+
+- Added a new class ATCTFileContent which contains some code for ATFile
+  and ATImage.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Set title from the filename of an uploaded file (ATImage, ATFile).
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added limit for ATTopic.
+  [gotcha]
+
+- Added EditableBody method to ATDocument.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added validation of Criterion support for a specific index.
+  [gotcha]
+
+- Added edit() methods for backward compatibility to CMF.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Added restrained folder support.
+  [jensens]
+
+- Disabled restrained folder support until it's fixed.
+  [tiran]
+
+0.2-beta5
+---------
+
+- Fixed multiple small bugs and added features requested in the bug
+  tracker on sf.net.
+  [tiran]
+
+- Auto set id from filename for ATImage and ATFile.

-  of Archetypes.
-  [fschulze]
-
-- Some general test cleanup in order to make the test output readable.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Removed the view alias of index.html for all standard content types. This
-  makes it possible to create and upload files called index.html to the
-  site, which is quite common when batch importing old sites into the site.
-  As someone might rely on the former behaviour, we do not migrate
-  any existing type information. This closes
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4837.

-- Added migration for #4865 to fix the grammar on existing instances.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Made the criteria to index type mapping a little more sane.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixed #4915: Smart Folders with path criteria where throwing errors on
-  unindex due to partial reference support.
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4915
-  [alecm]
-
-- Added And/Or operator to selection criterion.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixed #4590: Subfolders inherit the selected layout of their parent folders
-  if they are of the same type.
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4590
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixed #4512 - vCal export was not working with outlook.
-  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4512.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Use the ControlledMarshaller from the Marshall product if
-  available. Fallbacks to existing marshaller.
-  [sidnei]
-
-- Enable __dav_marshall__ by default on ATTopic, ATFolder and
-  ATBTreeFolder.
-  [sidnei]
-
-- Fixed #4572 and #4909 - Unicode problems with using kupu together
-  with mxTidy
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Fixed #4865 - Spelling error on location criteria.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- On invalid mimetypes the getIcon method of ATFile doesn't throw an exception
-  anymore but generates a log entry. This should minimize some migration
-  problems or at least tell the exact object with an invalid mimetype.
-  This should fix http://plone.org/collector/4979.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Correct some wrong security settings.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Code cleanup removing lots of unused import statements.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Fixed two issues with PathCriterion.  It was using depth 0 to get subfolders,
-  the proper parameter is depth -1.  Also, in order to properly handle the
-  references it holds, it must itself be cataloged in the UID catalog, and
-  have its references cataloged.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixed issue causing archetypes schema update to fail due to topic not
-  checking syndication state in initializeArchetype.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Added missing alternate views for folderish types.

-------------------------
-
-- Fixes for http://plone.org/collector/4709 __bobo_traverse__ doesn't
-  need or want a RESPONSE argument.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4734 It is generally a bad idea
-  to check permissions in bobo_traverse methods, especially permissions
-  that don't exist, especially if you then try to raise an exception that
-  you haven't actually imported.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fix two small i18n default text inconsistencies
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.0.0-final - 2005-09-05
-------------------------
-
-- Packaged 1.0.0 final with a tip of the hat to Christian Heimes who has
-  disappeared from our radar. We miss you, dude.
-  [stefan]
-
-- Made migration more tolerant of conflicting ids due to auto-created content
-  from manage_afterAdd or similar.  Fixes http://plone.org/collector/4468
-  [alecm]
-
-- Moved the exclude from navigation checkbox back to the properties tab, on
-  folderish objects, per request from limi.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixed two Smart folder issues: http://plone.org/collector/4594 we now fail
-  gracefully on bad limit settings, and http://plone.org/collector/4601 added
-  show/hide all link to the medatata control panel.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Changed Subject index/metadata title to Keywords, and added appropriate
-  description.
-  [alecm]
-
-1.0.0-rc5 - 2005-08-18
-----------------------
-
-- Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4429 by updating the modifySelectList.js
-  to deal with IE deficiencies.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Display files inline if they are of mimetype text/- thanks to LaurenceRowe
-  for the patch.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4448 index titles in smart folder's
-  criteria edit form were not translated
-  [hannosch]
-
-1.0.0-rc4 - 2005-08-09
-----------------------
-
-- Implemented the custom PUT_factory in both ATCTOrderedFolder and
-  ATCTBTreeFolder, as inheriting it from ATCTFolderMixin breaks when
-  LinguaPlone comes into play.
-  [stefan]
-
-- Enable syndication on topics by default.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Made inherit criteria field only appear when the parent of a Smart Folder
-  is also a Smart folder.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Added permissions checks to listSubTopics.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Remove Smart Folder syndication action as the action category has changed
-  in CMF.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixed bug in subtopic listing.
-  [alecm]
-
-1.0.0-rc3 - 2005-08-01
-----------------------
-
-- Change manage_copyObjects' permission to Copy or move, just copy from
-  Plone's PortalFolder.
-  [panjunyong]
-
-- Added method to fix the portal type name of CMF based objects
-  that were imported or copied from an unmigrated site to a migrated
-  site. The fix method is available in the type migration tab.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added code to remove deprecated external methods.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed an error in the module alias code for the exif library. Fixes
-  http://plone.org/collector/4352 - Uploading certain images causes ATCT
-  pickling errors
-  [tiran]
-
-- Expose some advanced migration options to the user by using new propertites
-  in the portal_atct tool.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Enhanced and updated documentation, mostly the feature documentations in
-  the portal_atct tool.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Moved migration related code from tool/atct.py to tool/migration.py. The
-  tool class was getting too long.
-  [tiran]
-
-1.0.0-rc2 - 2005-07-28
-----------------------
-
-- Updated requirements to CMFDynamicViewFTI 1.0.0 and ATRefBrowserWidget
-  1.1.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed error in config loader code. The loader must stop after the first
-  conf file is loaded or the conf file is overwritten by the default file.
-  [panjunyong]
-
-- Add optional arguments to ATTopic.queryCatalog to make it compatible with
-  getFolderContents (optional batching, return full objects instead of
-  brains).  Make the album_view compatible with Smart Folders.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Added fix for exif issue when rescaling the original image.  The exif
-  information is now stored before the image is set.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added a main macro to a few templates so they display nicely when used in
-  discussion_reply_form.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Added workaround for broken WebDAV/FTP clients like Mac OS X Finder.
-  PUT_factory is patched to use the default_PUT_factory which creates
-  standard Zope objects instead of CMF/AT content objects.
-  Thx to Nate and ATAudio for the idea.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed http://members.plone.org/collector/4321 which was caused by three
-  distinct bugs. 1) The initial rename of the CMF object didn't preserve
-  order, but rather moved the object to the end of the list.  2) When
-  migrating folders the check for orderability on self.new always failed
-  because self.new is None at this point, so ordering wasn't attempted.
-  3) When going through the subobjects of a folder the position was noted,
-  and then the object deleted, the next object was now in the same position
-  as the prior one and the order was lost.  Now there is a seperate loop to
-  delete the objects after the loop which marks the order and preserves the
-  object.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixed some minor issues with the relative url and CMF uid handling in
-  ATFavorite.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added AT and CMF uid migration to the migration system.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed the unit test fixture and ATFavorite unit tests. Now tests aren't
-  running as Manager only when really needed.
-  [tiran]
-
-1.0.0-rc1 - 2005-07-23
-----------------------
-
-- Fixed error in version parsing which somehow made portal_types disappear.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Enabled swallowResizeExceptions by default and added warning that original
-  image resizing destroies the exif information before the data is saved.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed spelling error in a security declaration of ATTopic.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed critical migration issue. Locally added roles and locally changed
-  permissions are now migrated. Also added unit tests to verify the
-  migration.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Cleanup up unit tests and logging to reduce the noise
-  [tiran]
-
-- Removed 'MakerNote JPEGThumbnail' from the exif tags. Some cameras might
-  store the thumbnail in this tag.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Removed unused customization policy including unit test. Plone 2.1 always
-  installing ATCT.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed 4330 Inter-version ATCT migration fails to migrate types
-  to CMFDynamicViewFTI. Migration to the new FTI is part of the version
-  migration again.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added migration step + unit test for '(selected layout)' change.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Optimized getRawRelatedItems index addition. There is no need to reindex
-  the *whole* catalog when adding a *single* index.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Made the 'view' method aliases point to '(selected layout)' instead of
-  '(default view)'. This assures consistency with previous behaviour,
-  so that /view at the end of a URL always gets the item itself, ignoring
-  any default-page that may be set. Note that the 'view' *action* still
-  points to 'string:${object_url}', so that the 'view' tab, as well as
-  the '(Default)' target, still get '(dynamic view)' (and thus default
-  pages) for types other than File and Image.
-  [optilude]
-
-- Added migration/othermigrator.py for other migrators like CMFPhoto and
-  CMFPhotoAlbum. These migrators are written but not yet available to end
-  users. Some glue code needs to be written.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Moved exif library to a new directory thirdparty/. This directory should
-  contain all third party extensions that are required to run ATCT. Well
-  lib/ was added for this purpose the first time. thirdparty/ is added to
-  sys.path at position three which is right after Zope's instance home
-  and zope home in most cases.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Removed lot's of unused imports.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4083 for atct_album_view.pt
-  [ender]
-
-- Fixed
-  http://sf.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=645337&aid=1215755&group_id=55262
-  by making the template sane.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixed get_size for ATImage. It should return only the file size of the
-  original image.
-  [tiran]
-
-- HEAD fixes for folder based content types.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed permission issue in formatCatalogMetadata.py.
-  [alecm]
-
-- ConstrainTypes should default to disabled unless the parent object is of
-  the same portal type.
-  [alecm]
-
-- General get_size fixes. The get_size() method returns either the size
-  of the primary field or 1 for folders.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Moved not yet implemented URL upload feature out of the main code.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed constraintypes's allowedContentTypes and invokeFactory to make
-  ENABLED mode work when the portal_type is different with parent's.
-  [panjunyong]
-
-- Added http access functionl http tests.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added HEAD() method to Topic. If the topic has at least one criterion or
-  it can acquire a query 200 OK is return else 404 NotFound
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed [Plone] 4295/ 1 Request "ATCT and related items fields".
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added workaround for [ 1229206 ] 2.0.5 > 2.1 migration fails. Failing
-  reorder is mostly harmless.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added workarounds for EXIF MakerNote errors. Some cameras are *really*
-  broken. Better no make notes than no exif infos at all.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed and improved recent changes to cleanupFilename(). You can't remove
-  features w/o keeping backward compatibility and new features must be
-  bullet proof!
-  [tiran]
-
-- Clean up multiple Topic folder_contents tabs.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Readded a seperate _cleanupFilename method for ATCTFileContent to make it
-  better for patch.
-  [panjunyong]
-
-- Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4218 ATCT now uses normalizeString from
-  PloneTool.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4170 Link checking is crazy and [ 1197068 ]
-  [hannosch]
-
-- made constraintypes default ACQUIRE mode works with portal_factory
-  [panjunyong]
-
-- Added Five/Zope3 interface bridges
-  [tiran]
-
-- Disabled text/x-python and text/plain-pre by default. Customize the
-  atcontenttypes.conf if you need them.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Removed relatedItems field from folderish objects.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Made download tab for File and Image invisible.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed __bobo_traverse__ in ATImage, security check was unnecessary and
-  required anonymous to have 'View' in order for anyone to use it.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Yet another migration optimization: Added catalogpatch to the migration
-  system. The patch is altering portal_catalog.catalog_object and
-  uncatalog_object. Read migration/catalogpatch.py for more informations.
-  The catalog patch can be enabled by passing use_catalog_patch=True to
-  the migration functions.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed last bit of http://plone.org/collector/3060  Don't let missing CMF
-  types crash portal_atct.disableCMFTypes().
-  [alecm]
-
-- Enhanced migration code:
-   - CatalogWalkerWithLevel is now based on ExtendedPathIndex
-     and behaves like CatalogWalker.
-   - Added walker arguments for transaction size, full transactions.
-     and savepoints. The migration system can use ZODB savepoints to
-     roll back to a sane point.
-   - Migrators are also registered by (src,dst) meta_type.
-   - The new function migratePortalType() can be used to migrate a single
-     content type by just passing the src and dst portal type to the
-     function. Both portal types must be registerd in portal_types and a
-     migration from src to dst meta_type must exist.
-
-  [tiran]
-
-- Don't catalog all types in _catalogTypesByMetatype it the passed list is
-  empty.
-  [jenner, alecm]
-
-- Modified templates to use the new pretty_title_or_id feature from plone.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Made atct_album_view use the catalog like other listings, and reuse the
-  nice macro from folder_listing.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Zope2.7 compatibility again: replaced import transaction with from
-  Products.CMFPlone import transaction.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Some minor i18n tweaks.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Updated INSTALL.txt for CMF 1.5. Zope 2.8 and more
-  [tiran]
-
-- CMF 1.5 / Zope2.8 compatibility:
-   - replaced CMFCorePermissions with permissions
-   - replaced get_transaction() with transaction
-   - removed product argument from TooolInit()
-   - logging.getLogger() and LOG.debug() etc.
-
-  [tiran]
-
-- Greatly enhanced logging during migration.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Chunked migration in smaller pieces. To be continued!
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed finalize migration so that it doesn't reinitialize the workflow
-  state.  Added unit tests for workflow, local_role, and owner migration.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Using migration code from DynamicViewFTI instead of own FTI migration code
-  [tiran]
-
-- Moved ATCTImageTransform class to lib
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added configuration options for PIL quality and resize algo.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Couple of bug fixes in the FTI->FTI w/ dynamic views migration
-  [rafrombrc]
-
-- Renamed max_size config option to max_file_size. Added max_image_dimension
-  config option to set the maximum border for the original size of an image.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added some additional i18n markup.
-  [hannosch]
-
-Snapshot 2005-07-05
--------------------
-
-- Don't run version migration when installing the first time. People should run it
-  after type migration.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Disabled full catalog updated after type migration. If people need it they could
-  do it after migration.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added migration to DynamicFTIs.
-  [fschulze]
-
-- Changed index_html method on ATCTOrderedFolder to gracefully handle
-  situation where acquisition of index_html attribute returns None.
-  [rafrombrc]
-
-- Added syndication support to Smart Folders.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixing up aliases and actions for CMF 1.5-style browser-default code, using
-  CMFDynamicViewFTI.
-  [optilude]
-
-- Some code related to browser default is moved to CMFDynamicViewFTI. All
-  new versions of ATCT depend on this product now.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed some tests on Windows. Image files must be opened with 'rb'.
-  [hannosch]
-
-- Moved around some fields. excludeFromNav is on the property sheet expect for
-  folderish items and discussion is on the main sheet expecpt for folderish and
-  Favorite.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added finalizeATCTSchema function to move the fields in the right position
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed http://plone.org/collector/4127 permission incorrect on
-  listSubtopics.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Added migration to change the name of the Topic configlet.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixed http://members.plone.org/collector/4076, adding exclude_from_nav to
-  all content schemas.
-  [optilude]
-
-- Fixes for migration of cataloged non-contentish objects.  Now checking
-  meta_type and portal_type before migration steps.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixed http://members.plone.org/collector/3804 added validation of filename
-  when appropriate using check_id if available.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Added index for relatedItems, and migration to install it into already
-  installed instances.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Made the tool check if a config entry is available whenever it finds a new
-  index, so that it is automatically enabled if desirable, and to minimize
-  the need for migrations.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Disabled all indexes in criteria form by default, only those with
-  default values are automatically enabled.  This prevents things like ZWiki
-  from messing up our nice edit form.  They can be enabled and prettified in
-  the tool.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Spring i18n cleanup:
-  - changed i18n:domain from plone to atcontenttypes
-  - added missing i18n markup
-  - fixed page templates XHTML errors
-  - reindented and cleaned up whitespaces
-  [deo]
-
-- Made portal_type, selection, and reference criteria return reasonably
-  sorted lists.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Updated folderlisting actions to work properly with optiludes new
-  browserdefault behavior.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Localized date in Topic custom view.
-  [alecm]
-
-1.0-alpha2
-----------
-
-- Disabled history tab.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed a small bug in the exif support. The signatur of the process_file
-  method has changed.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Catch KeyErrors on third party index types in the catalog.  Fix bad import
-  of list criteria.  Fix some unit tests that I broke, and added some more
-  (CriterionRegistry) in penance.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Updated exif lib.
-  [russf]
-
-- Added default values for the index/metadata friendly names, descriptions,
-  and criteria restrictions for Smart Folders using ZConfig.  Added the
-  ability to have an index with no criteria (useful for sort only criteria).
-  Made the descriptions for the criteria types more sensible (I hope this
-  doesn't screw up existing translations, but the current names are terrible).
-  Also, added some missing criteria related strings to manual.pot.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Added a getCriteriaUniqueWidgetAttr method to topics to compile things like
-  'helper_js' in one place for the edit form.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixed [ 1196809 ] Use getMutator(self) instead of mutator(self) in base.py.
-  [stefan]
-
-- Added new path criterion for use with ExtendedPathIndex that allows users
-  to select paths to search in using a sitemap.  This now uses the
-  lovely ATReferenceBrowserWidget.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Add Topic to the list of allowed sub-objects for Topic during Migration.
-  It was missing before because the class allowed_content_types property
-  was being overwritten by the one from CMFTopics.
-  [alecm]
-
-- BrowserDefaultMixin.getAvailableLayouts() now returns a list of tuples
-  instead of a DisplayList. Required by interface change in Plone.
-  [optilude]
-
-- Added cool icons for vCal/iCal export and image rotation/flipping made by
-  the legendary Vidar Anderson.
-  [blacktar, tiran]
-
-- Replaced AttributeStorage with AnnotationStorage for Document:text,
-  File:file, Image:image, Event:text and NewsItem:text,image. This requires
-  Archetypes 1.3.5.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added new Current Author criterion which, when used with the Creator index,
-  gets all objects authored by the currently logged in user.  Also fixed some
-  permissions that were preventing normal users from viewing published topics.
-  Fixes issue [ 1176355 ].
-  [alecm]
-
-- Changed processForm to check for id conflicts using check_ids if available,
-  otherwise just `id in parent`. Also commit sub-transaction to make rename
-  work after portal_factory.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Added version migration system mostly copied from plone. Works automatically
-  during Plone 2.1 migration to bring plone 2.0 sites that started with ATCT
-  >= 0.2 up to date including changing and uncatalogging ATTopic criteria and
-  migrating CMF Topics.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixed a small bug in Topic migration introduced during the merge.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Made topic.addCriterion() return the newly added criterion object. That
-  it didn't before made things hard for python product developers.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Fixed bug #3773 (http://plone.org/collector/3773) validation check for
-  empty/non-existant files/images.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Changed the behavior of the date criteria to make the meaning of
-  each field clearer.  Now queries like 'More than 2 weeks ago' can be used,
-  and will behave as expected.  This causes some inconsistency in importing
-  CMFTopics.  Queries that were of the form 'min' 'x days' 'ago' are now
-  'less than x days ago' which is a min:max query with an upper limit of now.
-  The same goes for 'max' 'x days' 'ahead', all other queries should be close
-  to identical (modulo an earliestTime() where it makes sense).  The
-  inconsistency shouldn't be too important as the CMF date criteria was
-  entirely inscrutable.  Also changed some strings for criteria descriptions
-  for consistency. Fixes bug [ 1181418 ]. Thanks to Dean Jackson for filing
-  this bug and devising a reasonably usable UI.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Made the portal_types criteria work properly with either Types or
-  portal_types indexes.  Disabled types restrictions in TopicTool, now uses the
-  new Plone 2.1 search blacklist for types (site_properties.unfriendly_types).
-  This creates a plone 2.1 dependency. Also a change was made to the
-  atct_subtopic_form so that it now uses a macro from plone 2.1, this fixes
-  issue [ 1164541 ].
-  [alecm]
-
-- Reworked linked select lists for criteria to use custom XMLHTTPRequest code,
-  contained in modifySelectList.js.  I will eventually turn this into an AT
-  MasterSelectWidget for the master select of two linked select lists.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Added and enabled configlet for Topics, and unit tests for the criteria.
-  Fixed a persistency bug in TopicsTool, and a sort bug the in criteria
-  listing.  Added Missing.MV as a possible false value for Boolean Criterion.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Removed some configuration vars from config.py and the ZConfig schema.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Moved external types from ATCT to the new ATCTAddons product.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Remove path of filename from ATFile's title when upload a file using MS IE.
-  [panjunyong]
-
-- Merged uiteam-plip73-sanitize-short-names from the old plone
-  svn repos: diff http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/ATContentTypes/branches/1.0@6168
-  http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/ATContentTypes/branches/uiteam-plip73-sanitize-short-names
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added flag to determine whether an content object has undergone a successful
-  initial edit.  Use this flag along with detection of default naming to
-  rename object on inital edit.
-  [alecm]
-
-- Merged the topic tool branch into 1.0 XXX: insert history here.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Refactored ConstrainTypesMixin to support PLIP 78:
-
-   - DISABLED means use standard allowed types from portal_types
-   - ENABLED means use restrictions set
-   - ACQUIRE means use types from parent if parent is of same portal type,
-     else same as ENABLED (doesn't make sense to inherit from any content type)
-   - immediatelyAddableTypes field - for subset of allowed types to show in
-     the "add" menu
-   - turned off and removed disable constrain-types flag
-
-  [tiran]
-
-- Turn on TemplateMixin for everything - now directly supported in Plone
-  via "display" menu.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Merged plip #3 branch: auto ordering / sorting into the 1.0 branch.
-  Features / Changes:
-
-   - Added getObjPositioninParent and getObjSize as helper methods for
-     the catalog based folder listing to all types
-   - Added AutoSortSuppot and AutoOrderSupport to ATCT. AutoSortSupport is

-  like script.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Merged tiran-notypesdir-branch. It's renaming and moving lot's of modules
-  around. All content types are in the content/ package, criteria were moved

-  [deo]
-
-- Don't show PloneSite, TempFolder and criteria in constrain types list.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Disabled validator for ATEvent's phone field. Some people have reported that
-  they have issues because numbers and especially extensions are handle
-  differently in every country. Also see [ 974102 ] Can't enter phone extension
-  in phone number field.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added XXX report tool to ATCT. It's mostly a copy from the Zope3 XXX tools.

-  The tool also reports TODO and BBB (for backward compatibility).
-  [tiran]

-  isMailto validator to validation and enhanced the isUrl validator to support

-  ATCT edit not preserving text type selection, not ATCT bug be renaming
-  text/restructured to text/x-rst.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed [ 1158950 ] ATTopic default view wrong. This fix needs also a svn up
-  of CMFPlone 2.1.
-  [tiran]

-- Moved external storage based variants for ATFile and ATImage to a seperate
-  module. They won't make it in the official trunk unless the storage is

-
-  By default the permissions are restricted to manager only.

-  The new features are:
-
-   - getting the exif informations from images using Gene Cash's exif lib

-
-- Migrating filter content types, allowed content types and allow
-  discussion from cmf fti to atct fti.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Updated requirements to CMFQuickinstaller 1.5/cvs,
-  [tiran]
-
-- Starting to remove the switch* and migrate* external methods.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed default view of ATFolder. Pointing to view again makes a loop and
-  raises a hard to debug exception because TemplateMixin is trying to use
-  itself as default view which doesn't work.
-  [tiran]
-
-- FTests: install kupu and epoz when available. Moved function test suite to
-  ftests/
-  [tiran]

-  [tiran]
-
-- prepare ATFolder for use with TemplateMixin, use generic /view instead of
-  /folder_listing as default and immediate view.
-  [yenzenz]
-
-- Changed the way ConstrainTypes gets mixed in: Now ATCT is always subclassing
-  folders from the ConstrainTypes class and the schema is always in the folder
-  schema. Before this change ppl couldn't rely on the api. When the feature
-  is disabled the fields are not shown in the schema and the overwritten
-  methods are using a "shortcut" to the default methods.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Renamed some methods in the constrain mixin to start with _ct_ for a clean
-  name space.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added a tag methods to NewsItem for its image. Also changed the caption from

-  mixin are forced to be enabled in order to keep the tests sane and to test
-  all features under all circumstances.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Dismembered the big beast schemata.py in types/ and types/criteria. The
-  schemata are in the same modules as the types.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added content module which contains all important classes.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Replaced all `from foo import *` by explicit imports.
-  [tiran]

-  per type. It allows fine granulated permission settings.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed bug [ 1154073 ] criterion_edit_form.cpt(.metadata) has no default
-  action. The default action for the criterion edit form is save.

-  and for the plone control panel.
-  [tiran]

-  image caption to ATNewsItem.
-  [limi, tiran]
-
-- Added related items reference field to all types using Danny's reference
-  browser widget. The ATReferenceBrowserWidget has to be available.
-  http://svn.plone.org/archetypes/MoreFieldsAndWidgets/ATReferenceBrowserWidget.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Removed old debian/ directory. I don't maintain it any more so there is no
-  reason of having it in the CVS.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Removed QuotaSupport.py. It should never be in the official tree of ATCT.
-  [tiran]
-

-  install time.
-  [tiran]

-  file.
-  [tiran]

-  [tiran]
-
-- Cleaned up the migration suite a little bit and enhanced the doc strings.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Replaces the globalAllow hack by createTypeByName which doesn't make
-  security checks like "is the type implicitly or explicitly addable in the
-  folder". It shares the same codebase as the function from PloneUtilities
-  I once wrote to unfuck the create member area method.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Better traceback support inside the migration suite.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added knob to toggle the installation of LinguaPlone in ATCT install.
-  [tiran]

-  which fixes some more ordering issues.
-  [hahnfeld]

-  [ctheune]
-
-- Made HTML the default content type for documents (and news items).
-  [ctheune]
-

-  [tiran]
-

-  attributes. This can typically happen if there are problems with the
-  AccessContentsInfo permission.
-  [tesdal]
-
-- Removed support of Python 2.1 and 2.2 from INSTALL.txt. Some code like
-  migration requires new features of Python 2.3 like generators.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added note to INSTALL.txt that ATCT will soon drop support for Zope < 2.7.2.
-  [tiran]
-
-0.2.0-rc4 - 2004-11-30

-  migrator.py.
-  [tiran]

-
-- Added ATContentTypes Site customization policy.

-  [tiran]

-  [tiran]

-  fti.isConstructionAllowed(context) to verify that the type is constructable.
-  [tiran]
-
-- Added an option called enableConstrainMixin which is a boolean value
-  (checkbox). When set to false the constrain mixin is disabled and the

-  from portal_types.

-
-- Fixed [ 1030662 ] ConstrainMixin: Can't add an ATTopic to portal root by

-  [tiran]
-
-- Fixed problem with _getPortalTypeName in initializeArchetype() phase of
-  object creation. Before the fix the portal type name was the original type
-  name (e.g. ATDocument) because it was changed after the initializeArchetype
-  call by the portal types tool. This issue has caused some wired problems with
-  LinguaPlone and workflows.
-  [tiran]
-
-- ATFile file field and ATImage image field are now language independend.
-  Later I will add a I18NImage and I18NFile if needed. Having a seperate type
-  for language dependend content for file and image is in my opinion easier to
-  understand for people. Besides it's like Zope3.
-  [tiran]

-  moved to TemplateMixin some time ago.

+AT Content Types
+================
+
+Installation
+------------
+
+Please read INSTALL.txt for a list of requirements before installing this
+product. ATContentTypes requires new versions of Python, Zope, Plone and
+Archetypes. Make sure you've updated all products.
+
+Reporting bugs / feature requests
+---------------------------------
+
+Please use the Plone bug tracker at http://dev.plone.org/plone and use the
+Content Types component!
+
+Comparing CMF types with ATContentTypes
+---------------------------------------
+
+This is a very rough and short list of differences between the old CMF types
+and the new ATContentTypes types.
+
+* Archetypes: All types are written with Archetypes and have all features
+  default Archetypes based types have like:
+
+   - autogenerated edit forms based on the schema
+
+   - referenceable
+
+   - Easily enhanceable by subclassing or adding fields to the schema
+
+   - Transformations like restructured text, python source code highlighting,
+     pdf to html, office to html and many more.
+
+   - plugable validation of fields
+
+* Clean and documented API.
+
+* Translateable using LinguaPlone.
+  
+* Dynamic Views: All types are using the new dynamic view FTI that allows you
+  to choose the view template per instance. You can configure the templates in
+  the portal_types tool. This features is used to turn an ordinary folder into
+  a photo album by simple switching to a different view.
+  
+* Permissions per type and feature: Every type has its own add permission and
+  all features like template mixin have their own modify permission, too.
+
+* Numerous small adjustments and enhancements to all types for example:
+
+  - Images can be rotated through the web and have exif informations
+
+  - News Items have an image plus caption
+
+  - Events have a body text
+
+  - Documents have a history tab to show the last changes as an unified diff
+    view using the ZODB history.
