+- Use `zope.browserresource`.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Converted most tests from doctests to proper unit tests.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Fixed various native names of African languages. Added ``nd``, ``nr`` and
+  ``ve`` language codes. Thanks to Dwayne Bailey and Roche Compaan.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- The max_length argument was ignored by

+2.0 - 2010-07-18
+----------------
+
+- Use the standard libraries doctest module.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Update license to GPL version 2 only.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.1b1 - 2010-01-24
+------------------
+
+- In practice the Unidecode data didn't produce good enough results for various
+  languages. We therefor limit the transliteration approach again to latin-like
+  languages and introduce a UNIDECODE_LIMIT. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10107.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.1a3 - 2009-12-27
+------------------
+
+- Use the flag of Bangladesh for the Bengali language (code: bn) in general
+  and not only for the ``bn-bd`` variant. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9950.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Fixed the IIDNormalizer to generate valid CSS ID or Python variable names as
+  specified in its docstring. It no longer tries to preserve filename
+  extensions. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9708.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added a new explicit base normalizer for Thai, as the Unidecode based
+  transliteration isn't good enough.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added new specific normalizer for Japanese, which avoids the Unidecode based
+  transliteration. This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9914.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.1a2 - 2009-12-02
+------------------
+
+- Depend on and include ``Unidecode`` based transliterations. These provide
+  more meaningful results than unicodedata NFKD normalizations or hex codes.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added cs-cz combined language code. It solves problem with default language
+  on new Plone site creation (Safari/Mac).
+  [naro]
+
+- Added catalan flag. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9540
+  [ramon]
+
+- Added missing 'native' descriptions to pt-* combined languages.
+  [igbun]
+
+1.1a1 - 2009-04-04
+------------------
+
+- Removed the negotiator sub-package, as it hasn't been enabled or used yet.
+  The functionality is better placed as a WSGI-middleware.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Register all dependencies in setup.py. Move test dependencies into a
+  separate extra to keep the dependencies low so things like the normalizer
+  can be used in non-zope contexts.
+  [wichert]
+
+1.0.9 - Unreleased
+------------------
+
+- Added Romanian language as the language for the .ro TLD. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9152
+  [vincentfretin]
+
+1.0.8 - 2009-10-15
+------------------
+
+- Added new UNDERSCORE_START_REGEX to the file normalizer. This removes any
+  leading underscores from uploaded file names. Objects in Zope cannot start
+  with an underscore, so it makes little sense to generate suggested file
+  names which cannot work.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added bulgarian normalizer.
+  [vlado]
+
+1.0.7 - 2008-11-05
+------------------
+
+- Allow _ as a valid character in file names and URLs. Do not remove # from
+  file names. It only has a special meaning for URLs.
+  [hannosch, sidnei]
+
+1.0.6 - August 18, 2008
+-----------------------
+
+- Added normalization for a French-only character (igature of o and e)
+  which isn't part of ISO 8859-1. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7512.
+  [dbaty, hannosch]
+
+- Fixed the greek character normalization based on a patch by ggozad.
+  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8308.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Changed the default normalization of characters used in Scandinavian
+  languages to meet the most common rules. This is based on a discussion
+  with translators from all Scandinavian countries.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added a subdomain language negotiator (e.g. de.plone.org).
+  [stefan]
+
+1.0.5 - May 22, 2008
+--------------------
+
+- Added a new max_length argument to the normalize method. This allows you
+  to override the default values for the maximum length on a call basis.
+  [hannosch, fschulze]
+
+- Added a new MAX_URL_LENGTH constant used by the URL normalizer. It
+  defaults to 255.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added '`' to the list of dangerous chars, which will be removed by the
+  url and be replaced with a dash by the file name normalizer now.
+  [hannosch, mj]
+
+1.0.4 - April 19, 2008
+----------------------
+
+- If a dot was used in a url, the url was not lowercased. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7961.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.0.3 - February 13, 2008
+-------------------------
+
+- Updating the flag/language listings. Updating readme to include the flag
+  mapping logic. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7441.
+  [limi]
+
+- Adding all the Arabic-speaking countries with their respective flags, and
+  adding a generic flag to represent Arabic in general (verified to be OK with
+  two independent, native residents).
+  [limi]
+
+- Added tests for the filename and url request adapters. We have now 100%
+  test coverage.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Wrote tests for the locale-aware id normalizer and fixed a bug in it.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added more tests.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Removed unused and untested 'native' from country information.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Don't allow double quotes in normalized urls.
+  This closes http://dev.plone.org/archetypes/ticket/764.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.0.2 - November 24, 2007
+-------------------------
+
+- Remove those [] brackets from file names as well.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Increase the maximum filename size to 1023 and make it independently
+  configurable.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.0.1 - October 7, 2007
+-----------------------
+
+- Extend polish normalizer 'dashed L' to L. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6845.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added test for filename with non-ascii character and extension. Fixes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7128.
+  [dreamcatcher]
+
+1.0 - August 13, 2007
+---------------------
+
+- Added Polish normalizer which normalizes 'dashed l' to l. This fixes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6845.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.0rc1 - July 9, 2007
+---------------------
+
+- Merged udg-sprint branch. This adds a Zope3-based configurable language
+  negotiator with similar functionality as PloneLanguageTool. It is not
+  enabled by default.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added the reference to the Faroese flag.
+  [deo]
+
+- Remove more punctuation characters as for example using a comma in the
+  title results in a not so friendly ID. This closes
+  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6585.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.0b1 - March 5, 2007
+---------------------
+
+- Initial implementation.
