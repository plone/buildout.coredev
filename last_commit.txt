+=============================================================================
+Listing and working with Plone content objects using plone.app.contentlisting
+=============================================================================
+
+This is valid for Plone 4.1 upwards.
+
+Many of the operations for customizations, templates, views and portlets in
+Plone are related to lists of content objects. Their sources can be different,
+although usually they are some sort of catalog search, the contents of a
+particular folder or a list of objects from a relation.
+
+To make it simpler to work with these, we have made plone.app.contentlisting,
+which ensures that lists of content objects always behave in the same way and
+according to predefined interfaces, regardless of what the source of the
+objects are. The integrator shouldn't have to care whether the list of objects
+came from the catalog, an ORM or they are the actual objects.
+
+
+Making or getting a contentListing
+----------------------------------
+
+The typical way to get a contentlisting is to call one of two built-in views:
+
+
+Listing the contents of a Folder or Collection
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+In Page templates getting the contents of a folder or the results of a
+collection is as simple as this::
+
+    context/@@contentlisting
+
+Every template-writer's dream ;)
+
+.. note::
+
+    In previous versions there was only support to list the contents of a
+    folder with ``context/@@folderListing``. There was no collection support.
+    The ``@@folderListing`` view is kept for compatibility, but we encourage
+    you to use the ``@@contentlisting`` instead.
+    
+
+
+A real example of listing the titles of the content objects of a folder::
+
+  <ul>
+    <li tal:repeat="item context/@@contentlisting" tal:content="item/Title"/>
+  </ul>
+
+The context in which it is called defines which folder is listed or which
+collection results are queried.
+
+You can also use Python expressions to be able to pass parameters, like which
+content type or review state you want to use::
+
+  <li tal:repeat="item python:context.restrictedTraverse('@@contentlisting')(portal_type='Document')">
+
+Batching can be done like this::
+
+  <ul tal:define="
+      Batch python:modules['Products.CMFPlone'].Batch;
+      b_size python:int(request.get('b_size', 20));
+      b_start python:int(request.get('b_start', 0));
+      results python:context.restrictedTraverse('@@contentlisting')(batch=True, b_size=b_size, b_start=b_start);
+      batch python:Batch(results, b_size, b_start);">
+    <li tal:repeat="item results"
+        tal:content="item/Title" />
+    <div metal:use-macro="context/batch_macros/macros/navigation" />
+  </ul>
+
+Note that you iterate directly over the results that you get from
+``@@contentlisting``.  The definition of ``batch`` is only used in the
+``batch_macros`` call.
+
+In Python a ContentListing of a particular folder's contents can be fetched
+by using::
+
+    >>> path.to.your.folder.restrictedTraverse('@@contentlisting')()
+
+Exactly the same for collections::
+
+    >>> path.to.your.collection.restrictedTraverse('@@contentlisting')()
+
+The contentlisting view called above implements all the logic the old
+getFolderContents script in Plone used to do. The old script has been left in
+place to not break compatibility for customizations and add-ons that might
+depend on its particular return values.
+
+
+Rolling your own with adaption
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+At the time of writing, all parts of Plone do not yet return 'contentlistings'
+when asked for lists of content. It was impossible to change this everywhere
+without breaking backwards compatibility. Therefore you may have to convert
+your sequence of stuff to a contentlisting manually.
+
+To do this, you need to import and adapt::
+
+    >>> from plone.app.contentlisting.interfaces import IContentListing
+    >>> catalog = getToolByName(self.portal, 'portal_catalog')
+    >>> results = catalog.searchResults()
+    >>> contentlist = IContentListing(results)
+    >>> print(contentlist)
+    <plone.app.contentlisting.contentlisting.ContentListing object ...>
+
+
+The contentListing, its properties and behaviors
+------------------------------------------------
+
+Now, you no longer need to worry whether you have a bunch of catalog brains or
+the actual objects (or fake objects for that sake). As long as you have a
+contentlisting, you know what you can expect from it. You also know what you
+can expect from each item within it - a content listing object.
+
+The content listing is a normal iterator that we can loop over and do all sorts
+of stuff you normally can do with sequences.
+
+
+contentListingObjects, the items inside the sequence
+-----------------------------------------------------
+
+The `contentListingObjects` are wrapper objects, each representing a content
+object in the site. Their intention is to be predictable so you can always call
+at least a common base set of methods on the objects listed.
+
+You do not have to be aware whether the object originates from a brain, a full
+object or something else. If you try to call a method or access an attribute of
+the object and the wrapper is not aware of it, it will silently fetch the real
+object and delegate the call to it. This means you can treat your objects as
+you would any other -- even writing to it.
+
+
+Methods of contentlistingObjects
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+getId() -
+  Returns the object id in its container for example `my-example-page`.
+
+getObject() -
+  Returns the real object
+
+def getDataOrigin() -
+  The origin of the data for the object.
+
+getPath() -
+  Path to the object, relative to the site root for example
+  ``/artifacts/my-example-page``
+
+getURL()-
+  Full url to the object, including the site root for example
+  ``http://my.site.com/artifacts/my-example-page``
+
+uuid() -
+  Unique content identifier for example an uuid from `plone.uuid` The only real
+  point of it is to be unique. It can for example look like this
+  `b0e80776-d41d-4f48-bf9e-7cb1aebabad5`.
+
+getIcon() -
+  Icon for the object. Returns an icon object from plone.app.layout.
+  If printed as a string, it will produce an HTML tag for the icon. Check
+  plone.app.layout for more info.
+
+getSize() -
+  Size in bytes for example `24`.
+
+review_state() -
+  Workflow review state for example `published`.
+
+ContentTypeClass() -
+  A normalized type name that identifies the object in listings. Used for CSS
+  styling, for example `content-type-page`.
+
+Title() -
+  Return a single string, the DCMI Title element (resource name).
+  For example `My example page`.
+
+Description() -
+  Return the DCMI Description element (resource summary). Result is a natural
+  language description of this object. Description is a plain text string
+  describing the object. It should not contain HTML or similar.
+
+Type() -
+  Return the DCMI Type element (resource type). Result is a human-readable
+  message id for the resource (typically the Title of its type info object).
+  For example `u'Page'` from the `plone` domain.
+
+listCreators() -
+  Return a sequence of DCMI Creator elements (resource authors).
+  Depending on the implementation, this returns the full name(s) of the
+  author(s) of the content object or their ids. For example `Jane Smith`.
+
+Creator() -
+  Return the first DCMI Creator element, or an empty string.
+  For example `Jane Smith`.
+
+Subject() -
+  Return a sequence of DCMI Subject elements (resource keywords).
+  Result is zero or more keywords associated with the content object.
+  These are the tags in Plone. For example ``['Ecology', 'Sustainability']``.
+
+Publisher() -
+  Return the DCMI Publisher element (resource publisher). Result is the full
+  formal name of the entity or person responsible for publishing the resource.
+  For example `Plone Foundation`.
+
+listContributors() -
+  Return a sequence of DCMI Contributor elements (resource collaborators).
+  Return zero or more collaborators (beyond those returned by `listCreators`).
+
+Contributors() -
+  Deprecated alias for `listContributors`.
+
+Date(zone=None) -
+  Return the DCMI Date element (default resource date). Result is a string,
+  formatted 'YYYY-MM-DD H24:MN:SS TZ'. The zone keyword is not yet supported
+  (but is part of the DublinCore interface and has to stay)
+
+CreationDate(zone=None) -
+  Return the DCMI Date element (date resource created). Result is a string,
+  formatted 'YYYY-MM-DD H24:MN:SS TZ'. The zone keyword is not yet supported
+  (but is part of the DublinCore interface and has to stay)
+
+EffectiveDate(zone=None) -
+  Return the DCMI Date element (date resource becomes effective). Result is a
+  string, formatted 'YYYY-MM-DD H24:MN:SS TZ', or None. The zone keyword is
+  not yet supported (but is part of the DublinCore interface and has to stay)
+
+ExpirationDate(zone=None) -
+  Return the DCMI Date element (date resource expires). Result is a string,
+  formatted 'YYYY-MM-DD H24:MN:SS TZ', or None. The zone keyword is not yet
+  supported (but is part of the DublinCore interface and has to stay)
+
+ModificationDate(zone=None) -
+  DCMI Date element - date resource last modified. Result is a string,
+  formatted 'YYYY-MM-DD H24:MN:SS TZ'. The zone keyword is not yet supported
+  (but is part of the DublinCore interface and has to stay)
+
+Format() -
+  Return the DCMI Format element (resource format).
+  Result is the resource's MIME type (e.g. `text/html`, `image/png`, etc.).
+
+Identifier() -
+  Return the DCMI Identifier element (resource ID). Result is a unique ID
+  (a URL) for the resource.
+
+Language() -
+  DCMI Language element (resource language). Result it the RFC language code
+  (e.g. `en-US`, `pt-BR`) for the resource.
+
+Rights() -
+  Return the DCMI Rights element (resource copyright). Return a string
+  describing the intellectual property status, if any, of the resource.
+
+isVisibleInNav() -
+  Return whether this object will be visible in a navigation view.
