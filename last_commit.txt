+Writing indexers
+================
+
+An indexer is a named adapter that adapts the type of an object and provides
+a value to be indexed when the catalog attempts to index the attribute with
+that name.
+
+For example, let's say we have two types, page and news item:
+
+    >>> from zope.interface import implements, Interface
+    >>> from zope import schema
+
+    >>> class IPage(Interface):
+    ...     text = schema.Text(title=u"Body text")
+    >>> class Page(object):
+    ...     implements(IPage)
+    ...     def __init__(self, text):
+    ...         self.text = text
+
+    >>> class INewsItem(Interface):
+    ...     summary = schema.TextLine(title=u"Short summary")
+    ...     story = schema.Text(title=u"Body text")
+    ...     audience = schema.TextLine(title=u"Audience")
+
+    >>> class NewsItem(object):
+    ...     implements(INewsItem)
+    ...     def __init__(self, summary, story, audience):
+    ...         self.summary = summary
+    ...         self.story = story
+    ...         self.audience = audience
+
+Now, pretend that our catalog had an index 'description', which for a page
+should contain the first 10 characters from the body text, and for a news
+item should contain the contents of the 'summary' field. Furthermore, there
+is an index 'audience' that should contain the value of the corresponding
+field for news items, in all uppercase. It should do nothing for pages.
+
+We could write indexers for all of these like this
+
+    >>> from plone.indexer import indexer
+
+    >>> @indexer(IPage)
+    ... def page_description(object):
+    ...     return object.text[:10]
+
+    >>> @indexer(INewsItem)
+    ... def newsitem_description(object):
+    ...     return object.summary
+
+    >>> @indexer(INewsItem)
+    ... def newsitem_audience(object):
+    ...     return object.audience.upper()
+
+These need to be registered as named adapters, where the name corresponds to
+the index name. In ZCML, that may be::
+
+    <adapter name="description" factory=".indexers.page_description" />
+    <adapter name="description" factory=".indexers.newsitem_description" />
+    <adapter name="audience" factory=".indexers.newsitem_audience" />
+
+We can omit the 'for' attribute because we passed this to the @indexer
+decorator, and we can omit the 'provides' attribute because the thing
+returned by the decorator is actually a class providing the required IIndexer
+interface.
+
+For the purposes of the ensuing tests, we'll register these directly.
+
+    >>> from zope.component import provideAdapter
+    >>> provideAdapter(page_description, name='description')
+    >>> provideAdapter(newsitem_description, name='description')
+    >>> provideAdapter(newsitem_audience, name='audience')
+
+Testing your indexers (or calling them directly)
+------------------------------------------------
+
+If you are writing tests for your indexers (as you should!), then you should
+be aware of the following:
+
+When the @indexer decorator returns, it turns your function into an instance
+of type DelegatingIndexerFactory. This is an adapter factory that can create
+a DelegatingIndexer, which in turn will call your function when asked to
+perform indexing operations.
+
+This means that you can't just call your function to test the indexer.
+Instead, you need to instantiate the adapter and then call the delegating
+indexer with the portal root as the first argument. For example:
+
+    >>> test_page = Page(text=u"My page with some text")
+    >>> page_description(test_page)()
+    u'My page wi'
+
+This will suffice in most cases. Note that there is actually a second
+parameter, catalog, which defaults to None. If you need to write an indexer
+that acts on catalog, you'll need to register a conventional adapter, as
+described in the next section.
+
+Other means of registering indexers
+-----------------------------------
+
+At the end of the day, an indexer is just a named multi-adapter from the
+indexable object (e.g. INewsItem or IPage above) and the catalog (usually
+portal_catalog in a CMF application) to IIndexer, where the name is the name
+of the indexed attribute in the catalog. Thus, you could register your
+indexers as more conventional adapters:
+
+    >>> from plone.indexer.interfaces import IIndexer
+    >>> from Products.ZCatalog.interfaces import IZCatalog
+
+    >>> from zope.interface import implements
+    >>> from zope.component import adapts
+    >>> class LengthIndexer(object):
+    ...     """Index the length of the body text
+    ...     """
+    ...     implements(IIndexer)
+    ...     adapts(IPage, IZCatalog)
+    ...
+    ...     def __init__(self, context, catalog):
+    ...         self.context = context
+    ...         self.catalog = catalog
+    ...
+    ...     def __call__(self):
+    ...         return len(self.context.text)
+
+We normally just use IZCatalog for the catalog adaptation, to apply to any
+catalog. However, if you want different indexers for different types of
+catalogs, there is an example later in this test.
+
+You'd register this with ZCML like so::
+
+    <adapter factory=".indexers.LengthIndexer" name="length" />
+
+Or in a test:
+
+    >>> provideAdapter(LengthIndexer, name="length")
+
+If you're only curious about how to write indexers, you can probably stop
+here. If you want to know more about how they work and how they are wired into
+a framework, read on.
+
+Hooking up indexers to the framework
+=====================================
+
+Here is a mock implementation of a ZCatalog.catalog_object() override, based
+on the one in Plone. We'll use this for testing. We won't bother with the full
+ZCatalog interface, only catalog_object(), and we'll stub out a few things.
+This really is for illustration purposes only, to show the intended usage
+pattern.
+
+In CMF 2.2, there is an IIndexableObject marker interface defined in
+Products.CMFCore.interfaces. We have a compatibility alias in this package
+for use with CMF 2.1.
+
+    >>> from OFS.interfaces import IItem
+    >>> from Products.ZCatalog.interfaces import IZCatalog
+    >>> from plone.indexer.interfaces import IIndexableObject
+    >>> from zope.component import queryMultiAdapter
+
+    >>> class FauxCatalog(object):
+    ...     implements(IZCatalog, IItem)
+    ...
+    ...     def catalog_object(self, object, uid, idxs=[]):
+    ...         """Pretend to index 'object' under the key 'uid'. We'll
+    ...         print the results of the indexing operation to the screen .
+    ...         """
+    ...
+    ...         if not IIndexableObject.providedBy(object):
+    ...             wrapper = queryMultiAdapter((object, self,), IIndexableObject)
+    ...             if wrapper is not None:
+    ...                 object = wrapper
+    ...
+    ...         # Perform the actual indexing of attributes in the idxs list
+    ...         for idx in idxs:
+    ...             try:
+    ...                 indexed_value = getattr(object, idx)
+    ...                 if callable(indexed_value):
+    ...                     indexed_value = indexed_value()
+    ...                 print idx, "=", indexed_value
+    ...             except (AttributeError, TypeError,):
+    ...                 pass
+
+The important things here are:
+
+    - We attempt to obtain an IIndexableObject for the object to be indexed.
+      This is just a way to get hold of an implementation of this interface
+      (we'll register one in a moment) and allow some coarse-grained overrides.
+
+    - Cataloging involves looking up attributes on the indexable object
+      wrapper matching the names of indexes (in the real ZCatalog, this is
+      actually decoupled, but let's not get carried away). If they are
+      callable, they should be called. This is just mimicking what ZCatalog's
+      implementation does.
+
+This package comes with an implementation of an IIndexableObject adapter that
+knows how to delegate to an IIndexer. Let's now register that as the default
+IIndexableObject wrapper adapter so that the code above will find it.
+
+    >>> from plone.indexer.wrapper import IndexableObjectWrapper
+    >>> from plone.indexer.interfaces import IIndexableObject
+    >>> provideAdapter(factory=IndexableObjectWrapper, adapts=(Interface, IZCatalog,), provides=IIndexableObject)
+
+Seeing it in action
+===================
+
+Now for the testing. First, we need a faux catalog:
+
+    >>> catalog = FauxCatalog()
+
+Finally, let's create some objects to index.
+
+    >>> page = Page(u"The page body text here")
+    >>> news = NewsItem(u"News summary", u"News body text", u"Audience")
+
+First of all, let's demonstrate that our indexers work and apply only to
+the types for which they are registered.
+
+    >>> catalog.catalog_object(page, 'p1', idxs=['description', 'audience', 'length'])
+    description = The page b
+    length = 23
+
+    >>> catalog.catalog_object(news, 'n1', idxs=['description', 'audience', 'length'])
+    description = News summary
+    audience = AUDIENCE
+
+Our custom indexable object wrapper is capable of looking up workflow
+variables if the portal_workflow tool is available. For testing purposes,
+we'll create a fake minimal workflow tool and stash it onto the fake catalog
+so that it can be found by getToolByName. In real life, it would of course be
+acquirable as normal.
+
+    >>> class FauxWorkflowTool(object):
+    ...     implements(IItem)
+    ...     def getCatalogVariablesFor(self, object):
+    ...         return dict(review_state='published', audience='Somebody')
+    >>> catalog.portal_workflow = FauxWorkflowTool()
+
+If we now index 'review_state', it will be obtained from the workflow
+variables. However, a custom indexer still overrides workflow variables.
+
+    >>> catalog.catalog_object(news, 'n1', idxs=['description', 'audience', 'review_state'])
+    description = News summary
+    audience = AUDIENCE
+    review_state = published
+
+Finally, if not adapter can be found, we fall back on getattr() on the object.
+
+    >>> catalog.catalog_object(page, 'p3', idxs=['description', 'text'])
+    description = The page b
+    text = The page body text here
+
+Customising indexers based on the catalog type
+==============================================
+
+It is possible to provide a custom indexer for a different type of catalog.
+To test that, let's create a secondary catalog and mark it with a marker
+interface.
+
+    >>> from zope.interface import Interface
+    >>> class IAlternateCatalog(Interface):
+    ...     pass
+    >>> from zope.interface import alsoProvides
+    >>> catalog2 = FauxCatalog()
+    >>> alsoProvides(catalog2, IAlternateCatalog)
+
+Let's say that we did not want the news item audience uppercased here. We
+could provide a custom indexer for just this catalog:
+
+    >>> @indexer(INewsItem, IAlternateCatalog)
+    ... def alternate_newsitem_audience(object):
+    ...     return object.audience.lower()
+    >>> provideAdapter(alternate_newsitem_audience, name='audience')
+
+This does not affect the first catalog:
+
+    >>> catalog.catalog_object(news, 'n1', idxs=['description', 'audience', 'length'])
+    description = News summary
+    audience = AUDIENCE
+
+However, the second catalog gets the audience in lowercase.
+
+    >>> catalog2.catalog_object(news, 'n1', idxs=['description', 'audience', 'length'])
+    description = News summary
+    audience = audience
+
+Interfaces provided by the wrapper
+==================================
+
+The indexable object wrapper has one particular feature: instances of the
+wrapper will provide the same interfaces as instances of the wrapped object.
+For example:
+
+    >>> from plone.indexer.interfaces import IIndexableObjectWrapper, IIndexableObject
+    >>> wrapper = IndexableObjectWrapper(page, catalog)
+    >>> IIndexableObjectWrapper.providedBy(wrapper)
+    True
+    >>> IIndexableObject.providedBy(wrapper)
+    True
+    >>> IPage.providedBy(wrapper)
+    True
+    >>> INewsItem.providedBy(wrapper)
+    False
+
+    >>> wrapper = IndexableObjectWrapper(news, catalog)
+    >>> IIndexableObjectWrapper.providedBy(wrapper)
+    True
+    >>> IPage.providedBy(wrapper)
+    False
+    >>> INewsItem.providedBy(wrapper)
+    True
+
+Unboxing
+========
+
+It is possible to obtain the wrapped object from the wrapper:
+
+    >>> wrapper = IndexableObjectWrapper(page, catalog)
+    >>> wrapper._getWrappedObject() is page
+    True

-    ...     text = schema.Text(title=u"Body text")
-    >>> class Page(object):
-    ...     implements(IPage)
-    ...     def __init__(self, text):
-    ...         self.text = text
-
-    >>> class INewsItem(Interface):
-    ...     summary = schema.TextLine(title=u"Short summary")
-    ...     story = schema.Text(title=u"Body text")
-    ...     audience = schema.TextLine(title=u"Audience")
-
-    >>> class NewsItem(object):
-    ...     implements(INewsItem)
-    ...     def __init__(self, summary, story, audience):
-    ...         self.summary = summary
-    ...         self.story = story
-    ...         self.audience = audience
-
-Now, pretend that our catalog had an index 'description', which for a page

-    ...     return object.summary
-
-    >>> @indexer(INewsItem)
-    ... def newsitem_audience(object):
-    ...     return object.audience.upper()
-

-Hooking up indexers to the framework
-=====================================
-
-Here is a mock implementation of a ZCatalog.catalog_object() override, based
-on the one in Plone. We'll use this for testing. We won't bother with the full
-ZCatalog interface, only catalog_object(), and we'll stub out a few things.
-This really is for illustration purposes only, to show the intended usage
-pattern.
-
-In CMF 2.2, there is an IIndexableObject marker interface defined in
-Products.CMFCore.interfaces. We have a compatibility alias in this package
-for use with CMF 2.1.
-
-    >>> from OFS.interfaces import IItem
-    >>> from Products.ZCatalog.interfaces import IZCatalog
-    >>> from plone.indexer.interfaces import IIndexableObject
-    >>> from zope.component import queryMultiAdapter
-
-    >>> class FauxCatalog(object):
-    ...     implements(IZCatalog, IItem)
-    ...
-    ...     def catalog_object(self, object, uid, idxs=[]):
-    ...         """Pretend to index 'object' under the key 'uid'. We'll
-    ...         print the results of the indexing operation to the screen .
-    ...         """
-    ...
-    ...         if not IIndexableObject.providedBy(object):
-    ...             wrapper = queryMultiAdapter((object, self,), IIndexableObject)
-    ...             if wrapper is not None:
-    ...                 object = wrapper
-    ...
-    ...         # Perform the actual indexing of attributes in the idxs list
-    ...         for idx in idxs:
-    ...             try:
-    ...                 indexed_value = getattr(object, idx)
-    ...                 if callable(indexed_value):
-    ...                     indexed_value = indexed_value()
-    ...                 print idx, "=", indexed_value
-    ...             except (AttributeError, TypeError,):
-    ...                 pass
-
-The important things here are:
-
-    - We attempt to obtain an IIndexableObject for the object to be indexed.
-      This is just a way to get hold of an implementation of this interface
-      (we'll register one in a moment) and allow some coarse-grained overrides.
-
-    - Cataloging involves looking up attributes on the indexable object
-      wrapper matching the names of indexes (in the real ZCatalog, this is
-      actually decoupled, but let's not get carried away). If they are
-      callable, they should be called. This is just mimicking what ZCatalog's
-      implementation does.
-
-This package comes with an implementation of an IIndexableObject adapter that
-knows how to delegate to an IIndexer. Let's now register that as the default
-IIndexableObject wrapper adapter so that the code above will find it.
-
-    >>> from plone.indexer.wrapper import IndexableObjectWrapper
-    >>> from plone.indexer.interfaces import IIndexableObject
-    >>> provideAdapter(factory=IndexableObjectWrapper, adapts=(Interface, IZCatalog,), provides=IIndexableObject)
-
-Seeing it in action
-===================
-
-Now for the testing. First, we need a faux catalog:
-
-    >>> catalog = FauxCatalog()
-
-Finally, let's create some objects to index.
-
-    >>> page = Page(u"The page body text here")
-    >>> news = NewsItem(u"News summary", u"News body text", u"Audience")
-
-First of all, let's demonstrate that our indexers work and apply only to
-the types for which they are registered.
-
-    >>> catalog.catalog_object(page, 'p1', idxs=['description', 'audience', 'length'])
-    description = The page b
-    length = 23
-
-    >>> catalog.catalog_object(news, 'n1', idxs=['description', 'audience', 'length'])
-    description = News summary
-    audience = AUDIENCE
-
-Our custom indexable object wrapper is capable of looking up workflow
-variables if the portal_workflow tool is available. For testing purposes,
-we'll create a fake minimal workflow tool and stash it onto the fake catalog
-so that it can be found by getToolByName. In real life, it would of course be
-acquirable as normal.
-
-    >>> class FauxWorkflowTool(object):
-    ...     implements(IItem)
-    ...     def getCatalogVariablesFor(self, object):
-    ...         return dict(review_state='published', audience='Somebody')
-    >>> catalog.portal_workflow = FauxWorkflowTool()
-
-If we now index 'review_state', it will be obtained from the workflow
-variables. However, a custom indexer still overrides workflow variables.
-
-    >>> catalog.catalog_object(news, 'n1', idxs=['description', 'audience', 'review_state'])
-    description = News summary
-    audience = AUDIENCE
-    review_state = published
-
-Finally, if not adapter can be found, we fall back on getattr() on the object.
-
-    >>> catalog.catalog_object(page, 'p3', idxs=['description', 'text'])
-    description = The page b
-    text = The page body text here
-
-Customising indexers based on the catalog type
-==============================================
-
-It is possible to provide a custom indexer for a different type of catalog.
-To test that, let's create a secondary catalog and mark it with a marker
-interface.
-
-    >>> from zope.interface import Interface
-    >>> class IAlternateCatalog(Interface):
-    ...     pass
-    >>> from zope.interface import alsoProvides
-    >>> catalog2 = FauxCatalog()
-    >>> alsoProvides(catalog2, IAlternateCatalog)
-
-Let's say that we did not want the news item audience uppercased here. We
-could provide a custom indexer for just this catalog:
-
-    >>> @indexer(INewsItem, IAlternateCatalog)
-    ... def alternate_newsitem_audience(object):
-    ...     return object.audience.lower()
-    >>> provideAdapter(alternate_newsitem_audience, name='audience')
-
-This does not affect the first catalog:
-
-    >>> catalog.catalog_object(news, 'n1', idxs=['description', 'audience', 'length'])
-    description = News summary
-    audience = AUDIENCE
-
-However, the second catalog gets the audience in lowercase.
-
-    >>> catalog2.catalog_object(news, 'n1', idxs=['description', 'audience', 'length'])
-    description = News summary
-    audience = audience
-
-Interfaces provided by the wrapper
-==================================
-
-The indexable object wrapper has one particular feature: instances of the
-wrapper will provide the same interfaces as instances of the wrapped object.
-For example:
-
-    >>> from plone.indexer.interfaces import IIndexableObjectWrapper, IIndexableObject
-    >>> wrapper = IndexableObjectWrapper(page, catalog)
-    >>> IIndexableObjectWrapper.providedBy(wrapper)
-    True
-    >>> IIndexableObject.providedBy(wrapper)
-    True
-    >>> IPage.providedBy(wrapper)
-    True
-    >>> INewsItem.providedBy(wrapper)
-    False
-
-    >>> wrapper = IndexableObjectWrapper(news, catalog)
-    >>> IIndexableObjectWrapper.providedBy(wrapper)
-    True
-    >>> IPage.providedBy(wrapper)
-    False
-    >>> INewsItem.providedBy(wrapper)
-    True
-
-Unboxing
-========
-
-It is possible to obtain the wrapped object from the wrapper:
-
-    >>> wrapper = IndexableObjectWrapper(page, catalog)
-    >>> wrapper._getWrappedObject() is page
-    True
