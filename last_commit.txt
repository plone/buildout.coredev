 Introduction

 In `Plone <http://plone.org>`_ versions 4.3 and higher you
 can edit your website theme through web browser in Plone's site setup control panel.
@@ -332,99 +332,107 @@ There are several ways to get the theme into Plone:
 
 1. On the filesystem
 
-If you used an installer or a standard "buildout" to set up your Plone site,
-you should have a directory called ``resources`` in the root of your Plone
-installation (this is created using the ``resources`` option to the buildout
-recipe ``plone.recipe.zope2instance``. See
-http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.zope2instance for more details.)
-
-You can find (or create) a ``theme`` directory inside this directory, which is
-used to contain themes. Each theme needs its own directory with a unique name.
-Create one (e.g. ``resources/theme/mytheme``) and put your HTML files and any
-references resources inside this directory. You can use subdirectories if you
-wish, but you are recommended to keep the basic theme HTML files at the top
-of the theme directory.
-
-You will also need a rules file called ``rules.xml`` inside this directory. If
-you haven't got one yet, start with an empty one::
-
-    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
-    <rules
-        xmlns="http://namespaces.plone.org/diazo"
-        xmlns:css="http://namespaces.plone.org/diazo/css"

-        <replace css:content-children="#content" css:theme-children="#main" />
-
-    </rules>
-
-Provided you are running Zope in debug mode (e.g. you start it up with
-``bin/instance fg``), changes to the theme and rules should take effect
-immediately. You can preview or enable the theme through the *Themes* control
-panel, and then iteratively modify the ``rules.xml`` file or the theme mockup

semantic linebreaks and some grammar fixes

Please, use semantic linebreaks: break at full sentences. Do not break after 78 or any other random number of characters. All lines are turned into translatable "po" files, and having half-sentences makes translation impossible. Do not worry about PEP8, that is for code.

+rather than compressing the directory in which they were found.
+To fix this, simply unzip the archive on your computer into a new directory, move up a level, and compress this directory on its own into a new Zip file, which you can then upload.

 There are several ways to get the theme into Plone:
 
 1. On the filesystem
 
-   If you used an installer or a standard "buildout" to set up your

-   root of your Plone installation (this is created using the
-   ``resources`` option to the buildout recipe
-   ``plone.recipe.zope2instance``. See
-   http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.zope2instance for more
-   details.)
-
-   You can find (or create) a ``theme`` directory inside this
-   directory, which is used to contain themes. Each theme needs its
-   own directory with a unique name.  Create one
-   (e.g. ``resources/theme/mytheme``) and put your HTML files and any
-   references resources inside this directory. You can use
-   subdirectories if you wish, but you are recommended to keep the
-   basic theme HTML files at the top of the theme directory.
-
-   You will also need a rules file called ``rules.xml`` inside this
-   directory. If you haven't got one yet, start with an empty one::

-If you cannot construct a suitable CSS 3 expression, you can use XPath

-(note the lack of a ``css:`` prefix when using XPath expressions). The two
-approaches are equivalent, and you can mix and match freely, but you cannot

 You can learn more about XPath at http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/default.asp.
 
 Conditions
 ++++++++++
 
-By default, every rule is executed, though rules that do not match any elements
-will of course do nothing. You can make a rule, set of rules or theme reference
-(see below) conditional upon an element appearing in the content by adding an
-attribute to the rule like ``css:if-content="#some-element"`` (to use an XPath
-expression instead, drop the ``css:`` prefix). If no elements match the
-expression, the rule is ignored.
-
-**Tip:** if a ``<replace />`` rule matches an element in the theme but not in
-the content, the theme node will be dropped (replaced with nothing). If you do
-not want this behavior and you are unsure if the content will contain the
-relevant element(s), you can use ``css:if-content`` conditional rule. Since
-this is a common scenario, there is a shortcut: ``css:if-content=""`` means
-"use the expression from the ``css:content`` attribute".
-
-Similarly, you can construct a condition based on the path of the current
-request by using an attribute like ``if-path="/news"`` (note that there is no
-``css:if-path`` ). If the path starts with a slash, it will match from the root
-of the Plone site. If it ends with a slash, it will match to the end of the URL.

 There are several ways to get the theme into Plone:
 
 1. On the filesystem
 
-If you used an installer or a standard "buildout" to set up your Plone site,
-you should have a directory called ``resources`` in the root of your Plone
-installation (this is created using the ``resources`` option to the buildout
-recipe ``plone.recipe.zope2instance``. See
-http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.zope2instance for more details.)

+   See http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.zope2instance for more details.)
 
-You can find (or create) a ``theme`` directory inside this directory, which is
-used to contain themes. Each theme needs its own directory with a unique name.
-Create one (e.g. ``resources/theme/mytheme``) and put your HTML files and any
-references resources inside this directory. You can use subdirectories if you
-wish, but you are recommended to keep the basic theme HTML files at the top
-of the theme directory.

-The standard selectors, ``css:theme`` and ``css:content``, operate on the

-matched element instead, use ``css:theme-children="..."`` or

+If you want to operate on the children of the matched element instead, use ``css:theme-children="..."`` or ``css:content-children="..."`` instead.
 
-If you cannot construct a suitable CSS 3 expression, you can use XPath
-expressions such as ``content="/head/link"`` or ``theme="//div[@id='main']"``
-(note the lack of a ``css:`` prefix when using XPath expressions). The two
-approaches are equivalent, and you can mix and match freely, but you cannot
-have e.g. both a ``css:theme`` and a ``theme`` attribute on a single rule. To
-operate on children of a node selected with an XPath expression, use
-``theme-children="..."`` or ``content-children="..."``.

 You can learn more about XPath at http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/default.asp.
 
 Conditions
 ++++++++++
 
-By default, every rule is executed, though rules that do not match any elements
-will of course do nothing. You can make a rule, set of rules or theme reference
-(see below) conditional upon an element appearing in the content by adding an
-attribute to the rule like ``css:if-content="#some-element"`` (to use an XPath
-expression instead, drop the ``css:`` prefix). If no elements match the
-expression, the rule is ignored.
-
-**Tip:** if a ``<replace />`` rule matches an element in the theme but not in
-the content, the theme node will be dropped (replaced with nothing). If you do
-not want this behavior and you are unsure if the content will contain the
-relevant element(s), you can use ``css:if-content`` conditional rule. Since
-this is a common scenario, there is a shortcut: ``css:if-content=""`` means
-"use the expression from the ``css:content`` attribute".
-
-Similarly, you can construct a condition based on the path of the current
-request by using an attribute like ``if-path="/news"`` (note that there is no
-``css:if-path`` ). If the path starts with a slash, it will match from the root
-of the Plone site. If it ends with a slash, it will match to the end of the URL.

+If it ends with a slash, it will match to the end of the URL.
 You can set an absolute path by using a leading and a trailing slash.
 
-Finally, you can use arbitrary XPath expressions against any defined variable
-using an attribute like ``if="$host = 'localhost'"`` . By default, the variables
-``url`` , ``scheme`` , ``host`` and ``base`` are available, representing the
-current URL. Themes may define additional variables in their manifests.
