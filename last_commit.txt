+Overview
+========
+
+This recipe creates and configures a ZEO server in parts. It also installs a
+control script in the bin/ directory. The name of the control script is the
+name of the part in buildout.
+
+You can use it with a part like this::
+
+  [zeo]
+  recipe = plone.recipe.zeoserver
+  zeo-address = 8100
+
+This will create a control script ``bin/zeo``.
+
+You can either start the database in foreground mode via ``bin/zeo fg`` or use
+the built-in zdaemon process control and use the ``start/stop/restart/status``
+commands. The foreground mode is suitable for running the process under general
+process control software like supervisord.
+
+Note: Windows support for this recipe is currently limited.
+
+Options
+-------
+
+The following options all affect the generated zeo.conf. If you want to have
+full control over the configuration file, see the ``zeo-conf`` option in the
+advanced options.
+
+Process
+-------
+
+zeo-address
+  Give a port for the ZEO server (either specify the port number only (with
+  '127.0.0.1' as default) or you use the format ``host:port``).
+  Defaults to ``8100``.
+
+effective-user
+  The name of the effective user for the ZEO process. Defaults to not setting
+  an effective user. This causes the process to run under the user account the
+  process has been started with.
+
+socket-name
+  The filename where ZEO will write its socket file.
+  Defaults to ``var/zeo.zdsock``.
+
+Storage
+-------
+
+storage-number
+  The number used to identify a storage. Defaults to ``1``.
+
+file-storage
+  The filename where the ZODB data file will be stored.
+  Defaults to ``var/filestorage/Data.fs``.
+
+blob-storage
+  The folder where the ZODB blob data files will be stored.
+  Defaults to ``var/blobstorage``.
+
+Logging
+-------
+
+zeo-log
+  The filename of the ZEO log file. Defaults to ``var/log/${partname}.log``.
+
+zeo-log-format
+  Format of logfile entries. Defaults to ``%(asctime)s %(message)s``.
+
+zeo-log-custom
+  A custom section for the eventlog, to be able to use another
+  event logger than ``logfile``. ``zeo-log`` is still used to set the logfile
+  value in the runner section.
+
+zeo-log-level
+  Control the logging level in the eventlog. Defaults to ``info``.
+
+Authentication
+--------------
+
+authentication-database
+  The filename for a authentication database. Only accounts listed in this
+  database will be allowed to access the ZEO server.
+
+  The format of the database file is::
+
+    realm <realm>
+    <username>:<hash>
+
+  Where the hash is generated via::
+
+    import sha
+    string = "%s:%s:%s" % (username, realm, password)
+    sha.new(string).hexdigest()
+
+authentication-realm
+  The authentication realm. Defaults to ``ZEO``.
+
+Packing
+-------
+
+pack-days
+  How many days of history should the zeopack script retain. Defaults to
+  one day.
+
+pack-gc
+  Can be set to ``false`` to disable garbage collection as part of the pack.
+  Defaults to ``true``.
+
+pack-keep-old
+  Can be set to ``false`` to disable the creation of ``*.fs.old`` files before
+  the pack is run. Defaults to ``true``.
+
+pack-user
+  If the ZEO server uses authentication, this is the username used by the
+  zeopack script to connect to the ZEO server.
+
+pack-password
+  If the ZEO server uses authentication, this is the password used by the
+  zeopack script to connect to the ZEO server.
+
+
+ZRS
+---
+
+First off, you'll need to specify the recipe to install zc.zrs. To do so,
+just slightly change the way the recipe option is specified in your zeoserver
+buildout part::
+
+    [zeoserver]
+    recipe = plone.recipe.zeoserver[zrs]
+    ...
+
+
+replicate-to
+    host:port combination this ZRS should liston to as a primary.
+    ZRS Secondaries connect here to get replication data.
+
+replicate-from
+    host:port combination of a ZRS primary this ZRS should connect to as a secondary.
+    This ZRS replicates the data it gets from the primary.
+
+keep-alive-delay
+    In some network configurations, TCP connections are broken after extended
+    periods of inactivity. This may even be done in a way that a client doesn't
+    detect the disconnection. To prevent this, you can use the keep-alive-delay
+    option to cause the secondary storage to send periodic no-operation
+    messages to the server.
+
+
+Monitoring
+----------
+
+monitor-address
+  The address at which the monitor server should listen. The monitor server
+  provides server statistics in a simple text format.
+
+Performance
+-----------
+
+invalidation-queue-size
+  The invalidation-queue-size used for the ZEO server. Defaults to ``100``.
+
+Customization
+-------------
+
+var
+  Used to configure the base directory for all things going into var.
+  Defaults to ${buildout:directory}/var.
+
+zeo-conf-additional
+  Give additional lines to zeo.conf. Make sure you indent any lines after
+  the one with the parameter. This allows you to use generated zeo.conf file
+  but add some minor additional lines to it.
+
+eggs
+  Set if you need to include other packages as eggs e.g. for making
+  application code available on the ZEO server side for performing
+  conflict resolution (through the _p_resolveConflict() handler).
+
+extra-paths
+  Specify additional directories which should be available to the control
+  scripts. Use this only for non-eggified Python packages.
+
+zeo-conf
+  A relative or absolute path to a zeo.conf file. This lets you provide a
+  completely custom configuration file and ignore most of the options in
+  this recipe.
+
+repozo
+  The path to the repozo.py backup script. A wrapper for this will be
+  generated in bin/repozo, which sets up the appropriate environment for
+  running this. Defaults to using the repozo script from the ZODB3 egg.
+  Set this to an empty value if you do not want this script to be generated.
+
+repozo-script-name
+  The name of the wrapper script to generate in `bin/`. Defaults to `repozo`.
+  Change this option if you have more than one instance of this recipe in
+  the one buildout to create separate scripts and avoid any one script being
+  overwritten.
+
+zeopack
+  The path to the zeopack.py backup script. A wrapper for this will be
+  generated in bin/zeopack (unless you change `zeopack-script-name`), which
+  sets up the appropriate environment to run this. Defaults to using the zeopack
+  script from the ZODB3 egg.  Set this option to an empty value if you do not
+  want this script to be generated.
+
+zeopack-script-name
+  The name of the wrapper script to generate in `bin/`. Defaults to `zeopack`.
+  Change this option if you have more than one instance of this recipe in
+  the one buildout to create separate scripts and avoid any one script being
+  overwritten.
+
+relative-paths
+  Set this to `true` to make the generated scripts use relative
+  paths. You can also enable this in the `[buildout]` section.
+
+read-only
+  Set zeoserver to run in read-only mode
+
+
+Usage
+-----
+
+zeopack
+  A zeopack script will be generated for you in the buildout bin directory,
+  unless you change the `zeopack-script-name` option, in which case the script
+  will be called the name you specify. If you'd like to use this script to pack
+  a different mount point, you'll need to specify `-S mount_name`. You can also
+  specify a `-B` option to not use the default blob directory.
+  You may override the pack-days by adding "-D #" to the command line where
+  "#" is the number of days to keep.
