# Release notes for Plone 6.0.0b1

Released: Saturday July 23, 2022.

## Highlights

Major changes since 6.0.0a6:

* `Products.CMFPlone`:
  * Removed our expressions patch. This was a patch to avoid some too strict checks by `Zope` / `Products.PageTemplates`. But in Plone 6 it should be fine to be stricter. The ``STRICT_TRAVERSE_CHECK`` environment variable is no longer read.
  * Initially open accordions in resource registry. Hide via JS when no errors occur. This makes it possible to fix a breaking error.
  * Resource bundle dependency on multiple comma separated names.
* `plone.staticresources`:
  * Register jquery and bootstrap globally. This helps a lot for add-ons.
  * Fix tinymce link/image modals.
* `plone.dexterity`: Remove long deprecated imports and fallbacks.
* `plonetheme.barceloneta`: Update to Bootstrap 5.2.0 (released this week).
* `plone.scale`: Fix to ensure that when a scale that was registered using `pre_scale` is later actually generated by `get_or_generate`, it is stored with the same uid as the placeholder info that was stored by `pre_scale`. This avoids an issue where the same scale was generated repeatedly.


## Volto frontend

The default frontend for Plone 6 is Volto. Latest release is [16.0.0-alpha.15](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@plone/volto/v/16.0.0-alpha.15).
This contains the much anticipated integration of the `volto-state` editor.  See the [changelog](https://github.com/plone/volto/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).


## Python compatibility

This release supports Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.
Support for Python 3.10 is still a bit provisional, as our testing infrastructure needs some updates before we can fully test this.
But your friendly Plone Release Manager is using Python 3.10 for local development, so it should be okay.


## Installation

For installation instructions, see the [documentation](https://6.dev-docs.plone.org/install/index.html).
This documentation is under development, but this should get you up and running.  No worries.
