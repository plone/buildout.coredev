# Release notes for Plone 6.1-dev

* Last updated: Monday July 8, 2024
* Check the [release schedule](https://plone.org/download/release-schedule).
* Read the [upgrade guide](https://6.docs.plone.org/backend/upgrading/version-specific-migration/upgrade-to-61.html), explaining the biggest changes compared to 6.0.
* Canonical place for these [release notes](https://dist.plone.org/release/6.1-dev/RELEASE-NOTES.md) and the full [packages changelog](https://dist.plone.org/release/6.1-dev/changelog.txt).

If you want to jump straight in, here are two important links:

* With pip you can use the constraints file at [https://dist.plone.org/release/6.1-dev/constraints.txt](https://dist.plone.org/release/6.1-dev/constraints.txt), plus optionally [`constraints-extra.txt`](https://dist.plone.org/release/6.1-dev/constraints-extra.txt) and [`constraints-ecosystem.txt`](https://dist.plone.org/release/6.1-dev/constraints-ecosystem.txt).  Note: in 6.0 we did not have these last two files.  This may still change.
* With Buildout you can use the versions file at [https://dist.plone.org/release/6.1-dev/versions.cfg](https://dist.plone.org/release/6.1-dev/versions.cfg), plus optionally [`versions-extra.cfg`](https://dist.plone.org/release/6.1-dev/versions-extra.cfg) and [`versions-ecosystem.cfg`](https://dist.plone.org/release/6.1-dev/versions-ecosystem.cfg).


## Highlights

Major changes since 6.1.0a3:

* `Products.CMFPlone`:
  * Made internal 6.1.0a4.dev0 release, only available on [https://dist.plone.org/release/6.1-dev](https://dist.plone.org/release/6.1-dev), so you will need this in your Buildout or pip find-links.  This is needed to unblock test setup in core packages.
  * Mockup TinyMCE settings: Remove deprecated AtD plugin settings.
  * Use details element for collapsibles in the resource registry.  Makes it possible to toggle elements even with broken or missing javascript.
  * Remove queryCatalog and getFolderContents skins script.
  * Plone upgrade page: show error when upgrade is needed but no upgrades are available.  Especially show a note when the `plone.app.upgrade` package is not available.
 * Plone upgrade page: show list of previously installed packages that are currently missing.  For example: `plone.app.discussion` may be missing in Plone 6.1, unless you explicitly add it, or depend on the `Plone` package.
* `plone.app.theming`: When calling the html serializer pass an encoding.  This is needed because we updated from `lxml` 4 to 5.
* `plone.app.iterate`: Remove old GenericSetup profile with id `plone.app.iterate`.  See [](https://github.com/plone/plone.app.iterate/issues/99#issuecomment-1484686642).
* Various package: remove `portal_properties` code.  This tool is scheduled for full removal in Plone 6.1.  If you use this tool in an add-on, you should move to storing settings in the `portal_registry` instead.
* `plone.base`:
  * Mockup TinyMCE settings: Remove deprecated AtD (After the Deadline spell checker) plugin settings and related views and interfaces.
  * Remove `ISearchSchemas` `types_not_searched` "Discussion Item" value to make `plone.app.discussion` a core addon.
    It is actually not needed anyway, also not part of the underlying vocabulary and would be lost on first save in control-panel.
* `plone.api`: Report if a permission does not exist when calling `api.user.has_permission`.
* `plone.restapi`:
  * Add cache rules for `@site` and `@navroot`.
  * Added `TeaserBlockSerializer` which updates the contents of a teaser block from its target if the block has `"overwrite": false`.


## Volto frontend

The default frontend for new Plone 6 sites is Volto.
Note that this is a JavaScript frontend that you need to run in a separate process with NodeJS.

Latest release is [17.18.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@plone/volto/v/17.18.0).  See the [changelog](https://github.com/plone/volto/blob/17.18.0/CHANGELOG.md).
You can also try Volto 18.0.0-alpha.39.  Most likely, the first final release of Plone 6.1 will use Volto 18.


## Classic UI

The HTML based and server side rendered UI that was present in Plone 5.2 and earlier major Plone releases is still available and has also been updated and improved upon in Plone 6.0 and 6.1.  Our documentation now refers to this frontend as 'Classic UI'.


## Docker

As we are still in the alpha stage, we are not yet creating `plone-backend` Docker images.


## Python compatibility

This release supports Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.


## pip, buildout, setuptools

In Plone core we use these versions to install Plone:

```
pip==24.0
setuptools==69.5.1
wheel==0.43.0
zc.buildout==3.0.1
```

In general you are free to use whatever versions work for you, but these worked for us.
