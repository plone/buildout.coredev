# Release notes for Plone 6.0.0a5 dev

Last updated: Friday June 24, 2022.

## Highlights

Major changes since 6.0.0a4:

* `plone.app.caching`: Remove unmaintained Split-View profile.
* `plone.app.content`:
  * Remove unused `container` and `item` modules.
  * Remove unused `IReindexOnModify`.
* `plone.app.i18n`, `plone.i18n`, `plone.app.multilingual`: Use SVG Flags in Language Selector, update name of flags, and prepare to use the Icon Resolver.
* `plone.app.upgrade`:
  * Removed old code, aliases and dependencies.  We only support upgrading from Plone 5.2 Python 3.
  * Upgrade profiles of core Plone modules to specific versions in the upgrade to alpha 5.  This way, when later upgrading a site from 5.2 to 6.1, these initial upgrades are done at the end of the alpha phase, instead of completely at the end.  This should avoid some surprises.
  * Add ``image_scales`` catalog metadata column.  Update all brains to get this info.  Since this takes long on large sites, you can disable this with an environment variable: ``export UPDATE_CATALOG_FOR_IMAGE_SCALES=0``.  In that case, you are advised to add the ``image_scales`` column manually to the catalog later.
* `Products.CMFPlone`:
  * Remove Archetypes specific code: ``isIDAutoGenerated``, ``PloneFolder``, ``DublinCore.py``.
  * Moved discussion Key to ``plone.app.discussion``.
* `plone.api`: In `content.get_view` and `portal.show_message` do not require the request parameter to be specified. If not specified, fallback to the global request.
* `plone.app.contentmenu`: Reimplement dropout toolbar submenus and collapsed icons.
* `plone.app.querystring`: Add negation-query operators ``plone.app.querystring.operation.string.isNot`` and ``plone.app.querystring.operation.selection.none``.
* `plone.app.robotframework`: Add keywords for making sure an element is visible before clicking: ``Wait For Element``, ``Wait For Then Click Element``, ``Wait For Then Click Invisible Element``.
* `plone.autoinclude`: Raise an exception when a module is not found.  When environment variable ``AUTOINCLUDE_ALLOW_MODULE_NOT_FOUND_ERROR=1`` is set, we log an error and continue.  To accept ``ModuleNotFoundError`` only in specific packages, use a comma-separated list of project names, with or without spaces.  See [issue 19](https://github.com/plone/plone.autoinclude/issues/19).




## Installation

Installation instructions are being added in this [documentation pull request](https://github.com/plone/documentation/pull/1260).  You can see a [preview](https://deploy-preview-1260--6-dev-docs-plone-org.netlify.app/install/index.html).

If you cannot follow these docs in progress, the following older notes can be useful.

Some documentation about installation:

* Installation instructions from the Mastering Plone 6 training:
https://training.plone.org/5/mastering-plone/installation.html
* Volto frontend installation:
https://docs.voltocms.com/getting-started/install/
* [Community post](https://community.plone.org/t/our-pip-based-development-workflow-for-plone/14562) on work in progress with [`plone-kickstarter`](https://github.com/bluedynamics/plone-kickstarter) and [`mxdev`](https://github.com/bluedynamics/mxdev).

If you use Docker, we have some images:

* `plone/plone-backend` (5.2 and 6.0)
* `plone/plone-frontend` (Volto)
* `plone/plone-haproxy`

If you don't do Docker, you will have to do the backend by hand.
The links above should give you information on how to install the prerequisites, like Python, also on Windows.
Here, we will focus on Unix-like systems (Linux, Mac OSX), but Windows should work as well.
The steps are:

* Install the Plone (Classic) backend with buildout or pip.
* Create the Plone Site in the browser.
* Install the Plone frontend (Volto) with node.

## Install backend with buildout

Change to a new directory and put a file `buildout.cfg` in it:

```
[buildout]
extends = https://dist.plone.org/release/6.0.0a5/versions.cfg
parts = instance

[instance]
recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
eggs =
    Plone
user = admin:admin
```

Install it with:

```
python3.9 -m venv .
bin/pip install -r https://dist.plone.org/release/6.0.0a5/requirements.txt
bin/buildout
bin/instance fg
```

## Install backend with pip

If you don't want to use buildout, you can install the Plone Python packages with `pip`.
Change to a new directory and then:

```
python3.9 -m venv .
bin/pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
bin/pip install Plone -c https://dist.plone.org/release/6.0.0a5/constraints.txt
bin/mkwsgiinstance -u admin:admin -d .
bin/runwsgi -v etc/zope.ini
```

Note: you may need to edit `etc/zope.conf` to add a `blob-dir`.
See [issue 3345](https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/3345#issuecomment-953700024)

## Create Plone backend

After you have installed the backend with buildout or pip, open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080/.
Click 'Create a new Plone site' to prepare for the new Volto frontend.
If you want Plone Classic instead, click 'Create Classic Plone site'.
(If this button is not available, then you did not install `plone.volto` with buildout or pip. 'Create a new Plone site' will create a Classic site then.)

Note: For Volto, make sure the Path identifier is Plone. You can change this, but then you need to change some Volto frontend configuration as well.

Submit the form and your backend is ready.
If you want Classic Plone, you are done.
If you want the full Plone 6 with Volto, read on.

## Frontend with node

You should probably read one of documentation pages linked above.
But the following gives you the general idea.

First install nvm, the Node Version Manager

* On Linux: `apt-get install nvm`
* On Mac: `brew install nvm`
* Or use the installation procedure detailed in the [nvm documentation](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

Create a Volto project:

```
nvm install --lts
npm install --global yarn
npm init yo @plone/volto
```

This will take long, and then ask for a project name.
It will create a directory with this name.
Go to that directory and start the frontend:

```
yarn start
```

In your browser go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

You are done. Welcome to Plone 6!
