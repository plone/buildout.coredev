----------------------------------------
New features:

Products.validation: 2.1.3 → 3.0.0
----------------------------------
Breaking changes:

- Removed `Products/validation/validators/validator.py`.
  This had backwards compatibility imports in a way that did not work on Python 3.
  So apparently no one needed this so far.
  [maurits] (#60)

- Drop support for Plone 5.2 and for Python 3.7 and lower.
  Only Plone 6.0 and 6.1 are supported now.
  Note that in Plone 6.1, this package is no longer tested together with the core.
  It has been moved to the ecosystem versions.
  [maurits] (#60)

New features:

- Move translations from plone.app.locales to here
  [erral] (#11)

Internal:

- Update configuration files.
