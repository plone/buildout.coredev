# When we have installed a PyPI release of Products.CMFPlone, it ends up in
# .venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/Products which means that all its zcml
# gets read automatically and its initialize function gets called.  This is
# handled by OFS.Application.  All is well.
#
# When we use a src checkout of Products.CMFPlone, this is not true.
# So we must explicitly load all its zcml.
# And separately we must add five:registerPackage to its configure.zcml,
# otherwise its initialize function is not called.
# Sample errors you can get when this is not done right:
#
# * ConfigurationError: ('Unknown directive', 'http://namespaces.zope.org/zope', 'autoIncludePluginsOverrides')
# * ConfigurationError: ('Unknown directive', 'http://namespaces.plone.org/plone', 'portlet')
# * KeyError: 'Unicode Whitespace splitter' (when creating a Plone Site)
#
# Note that once its zcml is loaded, CMFPlone uses plone/z3c.autoinclude,
# so for packages that use this, no explicit handling is needed here.
