PLIP 9324: Use Amberjack to offer guided help for first-time users
====================================================

This plip is in progress.

Plip ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9324

To do
-----

 * the whole aj should manage branches like 'if you are not logged in, then, log in'
 
 * collective.jqueryui. actually we have a js file in core/skins. it contains both jquery.ui and jquery.ui.draggable. 
 	we could remove the jquery.ui stuff and leave only a file ui.draggable.js.
 	unluckly, collective.js.jquery + ui.draggable.js doesn't work (raise a js error)
 	
 * write tests for:
	 - meta directives
	 - tour_manager
	 - ...	
 
 * create tours. Proposed mini tours:
	- Adding Google Analytics
	- Set up a New User Group
	- Adding a Folder (on Main Navigation)
	- Adding a Page (inside a folder)
	- Setting a Page as the Landing Page of a Folder
	- Arranging the Order of Content (= The Navigation Order)
	- Excluding Files from Aggregated Navigation
	- Creating an image gallery
	- What is a Page?
	- What is a News Item?
	- What is an Event? 
 
 * setUp/tearDown. provide a way to create an environment in which the user runs his tours.	explore possible security issues.
 
 * hide portlet if selected tour cannot run
 	if I set in the start portlet the tour A and it cannot be seen by the actual user, the portlet shouldn't be visible
 	
 * selection portlet
 	create a portlet on which a user can select the tour choosing between the registered ones / created ones.
 	the choice could be only between a subset defined by the guy who instanziated the portlet.

 * identify the page in a better way
	need to think to a different (or alternative way) to identify the page from the html it produces.
	xpath and xcontent may non be enought because of translations
	for example when you check for xcontent=Published for the state. 
	It doesn't work when the site is not in English and the user can't finish the tour.
	
 * check the entered texts: check if the texts entered in the fields are the ones we expected. 
 	if not we may have problems with ids (in the url) and with the xcontent.
	otherwise, let both url and xcontent be function of what the user entered. 	

 * check if the user completes the step: since every step is made by several microstep, 
   	provide a way to check if all of them has been completed before unloading the page and go to the next step
	if not ask him if he wants to let the system to autocomplete the step 

 * load the js stuff only if the tour is running 	

 * provide a way to create a tour using paster

 * adding the portlet when no tour is available
 	Actually you have to choose a tour and this is mandatory.
	If no tours are available you obviously create one.
	fix this in some way
