PLIP 9286: Allow to show/hide portlets
=================================================================

- Could we factor up the repetition between hide_portlet and show_portlet at
  https://dev.plone.org/old/plone/browser/plone.app.portlets/branches/plip9286-allow-show-hide-portlets/plone/app/portlets/browser/editmanager.py?rev=29095#L282 ?

    A: Yes, thanks for the suggestion. I refactored it and now we have
       toggle visibility methods, which simply change the "visible" value.

- Do we even want "specific symbols" for hide and show? Sometimes a word is
  worth a thousand pictures.

    A: Yes, maybe. But it will probably be a good idea to get more feedback
       about it.

- Another out-of-scope niggle: I assigned a portlet at the root of the site and
  was surprised I couldn't click "hide" at some lower level's Manage Portlets
  page. (It took me several few minutes to figure out where to see the new Hide
  link!) I can't change the ordering at inherited levels either, so at least
  you're consistent. However, I'd expect to be able to move and change the
  visibility of any portlet anywhere I can see it. After all, I can still click
  its title and edit its params. Since you're such a portlet jockey, do you have
  any idea how big a deal that would be to implement?

    A: I'm not sure. The new "visible" setting is stored as an annotation 
       at each specific portlet assignment.
       To be able to change the visibility of a portlet for each context, I
       think we'd need to set these settings at the context...

- As the to-do section says, this PLIP isn't done yet. We should probably do a
  migration for people who upgrade straight from the old plone.portlet.static to
  2.0, but your migrate-as-we-go code at
  https://dev.plone.org/old/plone/browser/plone.portlet.static/branches/plip9286-allow-show-hide-portlets/plone/portlet/static/static.py?rev=29096#L79
  goes a long way.

    A: The migration isn't finished yet. Comming soon.

All in all, great work so far. I can't see anything wrong with your code.


Update, 10/6/2009
-----------------

- Thanks for refactoring out the repetition! Looks great.

- There's a debugging log message still hanging around in
  https://dev.plone.org/old/plone/changeset/30100

- The changes at
  https://dev.plone.org/old/plone/changeset/30100/plone.app.portlets/branches/
  plip9286-allow-show-hide-portlets/plone/app/portlets/exportimport/portlets.py
  require true and false to be spelled as "0" and "1" in GS. Isn't the usual
  spelling "True"/"False"? I'd like to see this follow whatever convention
  everything else does. FWT: please remind me what the convention is.

- Migrations should probably still be done, though I can't remember why it's
  important anymore.

I'm -1 for the moment. Ricardo, if you have a chance to fix these few small
things in the next day or so, I'll be very happy to change that to +1. If not,
I don't see why this couldn't go in 4.1.
