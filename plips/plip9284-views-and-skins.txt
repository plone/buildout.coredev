PLIP 9284: Allow views to override skin layer elements easily
=============================================================
This PLIP is ready for review.
PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9272

Branches
--------

http://svn.zope.org/Products.CMFCore/branches/matthewwilkes-traversalprecedence

Summary of changes
------------------
- Added some interfaces for skin-related objects
- Register a new IPublishTraverse adapter for SkinnableObjectManager
- Add an unrestrictedTraverse implementation to SkinnableObjectManagers
- Change CMFCore's PortalObject to use that unrestrictedTraverse implementation
- Tests to prove new precedence occurs

Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

- The problem was an undocumented problem, so the only appropriate changes would
  be to highlight cases such as overriding the main_template.
