Review by: Maik Derstappen (<md@derico.de>)

Date: August 18, 2021

## Environment

The PLIP was reviewed using:

- Python 3.8.11 on Debian Bulleye

## Manual testing

I created a fresh Plone site and installed and unistalled an add-on.
Added some relations and checked the control panel.
Installing and unistalling add-ons works fine.

## Code review

Code look good, tests are provided.

## Versions

Package towncrier entries report new features.

This seems correct.

## Documentation

Most functionallity is self explained, but some user documentation would be good.

## Conclusion

The PLIP is ready to be merged.
