PLIP 9292: group management delegation
======================================

http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9292

Status
------

Coming back from vacations and speeding up the job.

Finished somehow to change collective.groupdelegation such it works in Plone 4
trunk. Unit tests are OK.

https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.groupdelegation/branches/plone4-plip9292

Note that this has been done in "old style" Controler Page Template such it can
be merged to the actual (Plone 4 trunk) users and groups control panel.

Changes
-------

..........

* Adding delegated managers to non mutable groups is now impossible (error
  message). Relevant test added. This needs more polish (i.e. we could hide the
  "delegation" tab)

Issues
------

* Actually we don't check if groups are mutable. Delegation of non mutable
  groups should be forbidden.

* To FWT: should we be in position to grant group delegation to guys who are not
  members of a group?

Todo
----

Functional test of main control panel.

Include all this in plone.app.controlpanel. But this requires a real refactoring
of the users/groups control panels such we do all this in new style control
panels.

BTW, I notice in the OTB groups control panel (prefs_group_members) that the
standard Plone logic enables to add uses to non mutable groupes (did'nt find a
ticket or PLIP on this). When adding a member to a non mutable group (i.e. to
'AuthenticatedUsers' dynamic group), it fails silently. IMO, this template
should not be available on such groups.
