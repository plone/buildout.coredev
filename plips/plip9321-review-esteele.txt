PLIP 9321: Reimplement the search form with an eye on usability
=======================================

Review #2 by Eric Steele, on behalf of the FWT (ems174@psu.edu, esteele on irc)

PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.5.7 using python 2.6.2 and Firefox 3.5.2.

Review steps
------------

 - Ran buildout using the plip9321-searchform.cfg file.

 - Ran tests for plone.app.controlpanel
 
 - Ran test coverage for plone.app.controlpanel
 
 - Visual inspection of the code
 
 - Start Zope, create new Plone site, view form at @@search-controlpanel
 
 - View search_form in while logged in and not.
 
Notes and observations
---------------------- 

 * Test coverage for plone.app.controlpanel/plone/app/controlpanel/search.py is 88%.

 * The "Show option to search in the title only" and "Show option to search in
   the description only" feel like they could be rewritten to be a bit more
   clear, but I'm at a loss to come up with a better bit of text.

 * Could use some more descriptions on each field.
 
 * Having a "required" next to a list of checkboxes is confusing. I think that
   should be removed.

 * Needs more consistent capitalization in the search_form labels ie "New
   items since" should probably be "New Items Since". Though it looks as
   though some of these are carryovers from Plone. Either way, we should be
   standardizing in one way or the other.
   
 * Plone provides a script to do collapsable sections. Consider using this
   instead. See "collapsiblesections.js".
  
 * Agree with Erik about collapsing all hidden sections under one big "more".
  
Conclusions 
-----------
+1 for inclusion. This adds some nice UI cleanup for the searchform which I've
always felt was overzealous in its granularity. In general, a lot of the
labels and descriptions could be rewritten to be a bit clearer. I'd reccommend
emailing the docs list to get some copyediting help. Some/most of the text was
there to begin with, but this presents a good opportunity to fix it up.
