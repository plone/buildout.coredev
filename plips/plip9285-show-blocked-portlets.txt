PLIP 9285: Show blocked portlets in management interface
=================================================================

This plip is in progress.

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9285

To do
-----

- Didn't branch CMFPlone for this PLIP, so when merging, some CSS nees to be
  added to CMFPlone/skins/plone_styles/portlets.css.dtml. Something like:

    .blockedPortlet .portletHeader {
        background-color: &dtml-discreetColor;;
    }

    .blockedPortlet .portletBlockedMessage {
        color: &dtml-discreetColor;;
    }

  At the moment, to make it easier to review, an existing class 
  ('inheritedPortlet') is being used to distinguish blocked portlets. 
  Class 'hiddenStructure' is also used to hide the accessibility message.
  Both should be removed after merging.

- Add unit tests.

- For global en inherited portlets, the edit link should only be shown if
  the user has permission to manage portlets on that specific context.

Summary of changes
------------------

- Changed the contextual portlet management screen to show all portlets 
  from global categories, identifying the portlets blocked categories.

- Changed the position of inherited portlets to be shown after the
  respective select box, making clear to which category they belong.

- Updated the portlet management description message according to the changes.

Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

- The Plone User Manual needs to be updated, more specifically the "Portlet
  Management" section:
  http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-3-user-manual/portlet-management/

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

This PLIP includes essentially presentational improvements. The changes made 
aren't expected to break existing functionality in any way.
