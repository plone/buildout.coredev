Status
------

Very minimal changes, very low risk, big win relative to small size.
+1 for merge.  Would still like to get some funkload benchmarks that
include this, working on adding searching content to the baseline
now.

Review Process
--------------

- bin/buildout -vN -c plips/plip9305-fullname.cfg
- Ran tests, generated a diff against failures from plipbase.cfg
- review the branch diff

- did a search for "welcome", got the front-page, no by-line
- turned on "Allow anyone to view 'about' information" in the site
  control panel/configlet
- did a search for "welcome", got the front-page, by-line with "admin"
- set admin fullname in profile
- did a search for "welcome", got the front-page, by-line with new
  full name
- clicked RSS link, fullname in dc:creator

- add profile-collective.contentgenerator:public to plipbase.cfg,
  re-run coreloadtests for baseline.  Ran into a problem with
  collective.contentgenerator, had to disable groups.
- add profile-collective.contentgenerator:public to
  plip9305-fullname.cfg, re-run coreloadtests for baseline

Needs Work
----------

- test failures

Some tests fail when this PLIP is deployed that didn't fail with
plipbase.cfg.  See plips/plip9305-review-rossp-tests.diff for the
differences.

Notes
-----

Looking at the diff for the branch, I'm not seeing where the fullname
is added to the author info, I only see the changes to the templates.
Is that all this PLIP involves now is template changes?
