=======================
Plone Developer Culture
=======================

If you are going to be contributing to Plone, we ask a couple things.
First, please join the `Plone forum <https://community.plone.org>`_ and at minimum lurk around.
You will quickly see how people work and what kind of things are best suited for group discussion.
Second, please ask for help setting up your environment, in the forum or in chat.

Most of our developers work there and you will get the best advice there.

For chat, browse to the `Plone Gitter channel <https://gitter.im/plone/public/>`_.
To send any messages, you will have to log in using a `GitHub <https://GitHub.com>`_ or `Twitter <https://Twitter.com>`_ account.

The people there have mostly been using Plone for a very long time and are happy to help you get going and make the right decisions.

More info on Plone chat can be found at http://plone.org/support/chat.

If you are actively committing code, always keep an eye on our `Jenkins CI <https://jenkins.plone.org/>`_ to know if your recent commits have broken (or fixed!) the build.

If you are in a timezone when things are not very active, please post to the forum or grab a drink and wait for people to wake up.

**When in doubt, please ask**!

The code base is very complicated and everyone is vested in the right thing happening.
Despite the occasional grouch here and there, most Plone devs will go out of their way to get you on the right path.
